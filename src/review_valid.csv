Review,Sentiment
"Just had a delicious dinner here with friends. I'm usually not a fan of Thai food, but every main we tried here was flavourful and well made. Had the red curry (such a complex sweet-rich curry, top pick!), three flavours pad Thai (great taste), and pad kee mao. We also shared the squash fritters, which were not that special or worth it in my opinion.   Interior decor is ecclectically colourful and the tables were packed. We arrived at 5:30pm on a Sunday and essentially got the last spot.   Definitely recommend for a date or get together with friends.",2
"I dropped by Khao San Road while visiting Toronto. After seeing all the good reviews it had, I wanted to try it for myself. I got the khao soi and have to say it is the BEST khao soi I've ever had. The curry is well balanced and packs a ton of flavor. Other khao sois I've had have too strong a flavor of fish sauce. The meat is also very tender and breaks apart easily. I love spicy food and most places aren't able to give me the level of heat that I want while cooking the dish so I appreciate that Khao San Road offers a variety of spice levels. I was tempted to try their hottest option but ended up going for Thai level spicy which ended up being the right level of spice for me.   Prices were pretty standard and I have no complaints about service. I know I'll be dreaming about the khao soi from this place until I have the chance to visit Toronto again.",2
"Shared the Squash Fritters (gra bong) with 3 people as appetizers. It was such a perfect start - crispy, fried to perfection, and not oily. The sweet dip enhances the taste and makes you munch on it again and again. For main, I had the Khao Soi, it was absolutely amazing. It's by far the best Khao Soi I've had in Downtown Toronto (I've tried PAI, Sabai Sabai, Sukhothai and Salad King). I love the soup, and the noodles blend perfectly well with it. The overall ambience is trendy and in an elegant, modern setting. There are plenty of seats (has a 2nd floor).  Khao San Road's portions is big - it's around the same price as the other Thai places but leaves you way more satisfied. My recommendation is to avoid the ridiculous line up at PAI and come here instead for equally (if not better) Thai food.",2
"It's one of the best Thai places in Toronto and of I'm not mistaken better than Pai... *GASP* But also because they take American Express which means (all major credit cards, which to me seems like it's a dime a dozen these days)  ALSO, their portions are generous and it's worth the money you pay (they are on the more expensive side, but portion size makes up for it).  We ordered:  -Panama curry-- less curry and more of a dry curry type but freaking DELICIOUS  -fried chicken- can't go wrong -fried squash- the plate was twice the size of my head  And it was WAY MORE than enough for a large hungry man and my petite self.",2
"Spice levels were a bit all over the place. The curry was spicier than the pad thai and chicken kua gling, even though we ordered it with less spice than the others.   The Thai iced tea was pretty good. Started out a bit syrupy but was perfect once the ice started melting.",1
"Hits and misses at one of the most popular Thai spots in the GTA. It's legacy will be for ushering in an era of outstanding and competitive Thai cuisine to Toronto... But as it currently stands, it's good but not worth the long waits.  What We Got: Pad Kee Mao (chicken), Chef Top's Massaman Curry (Tofu), Green Curry (chicken), Thai Iced Tea  What We Liked:  +curry was smooth and solid kick +Pad Kee Mao was a big standout - definitely one of my favourite dishes ($17) +Chicken didn't cost extra but beef did   What We Didn't:  -Thai Iced Tea was smooth but missing a ""tea"" flavour, especially as the ice slowly melted.  -Chef's curry is quite sweet - would recommend only to those who want to mix a sweet tooth with an entree. Also very heavy with plenty of potatoes -very noisy! Hard to have conversation and hear yourself -spice levels seemed a bit off. I swear the Pad Kee Mao at level 3 seemed to be more mild than the curry at Level 2. Felt like it was the other way around!   What We Recommend /Pad Kee Mao! Probably will try level 4 spicy next time, but I might stick with 3 just to doubly confirm next time  Next Time... Will probably try Pad Thai, Khao Soi and some appetizers. But let's be grateful for all these outstanding Thai options nowadays.   3.5, but I'll wait to round up based on subsequent visits!",1
"Multiple visits in the books even with their old location. Consistent flavours and everything tastes delicious.  Waits time are a bit of a mess here as they only seat complete parties. Dragging on the ""table will be ready in 5"" update for the next 45 minutes is a no.  For those looking to request less ice in their Thai iced tea: it's a smaller cup, but as per staff, equals large cup with regular ice.",2
"Khao San Road is one of the better Thai establishment in Toronto. The atmosphere can be a little loud, so it may not the best option if you are seeking a place to chat. There are great vegan options! The restaurant can also make special accommodation if you have a specialty diet.   Food is fresh and delicious! Most items such as pad thai sam roas ($14.95) with rice noodles, tamarind, tofu, bean sprout, fresh roasted peanuts, dried chili, lime, long leaf cilantro and pad kee mao ($14.95) with wide rice noodles, long green pepper, bamboo shoot, mushroom, thai basil, red bell pepper, faux oyster sauce substitute, soy sauce are made to order. It's great for a quick lunch if you manage to secure a seat.   Nom! Hot delicious pad thai! Yes! Get in my pad belly now!   Pro tip: visit right when Khao San Road opens at 11:30 to avoid the wait!",2
"Food: 4/5 Service: 3.5/5 Decor: 3/5 Price: 4/5  Small and quaint. When entering there was a sign warning about bugs that may look like cockroaches inside the restaurant. It says to not be alarmed they are not cockroaches and it is natural during the summer days for these little insects to find their way indoors. If spotted you can call a waiter to come by and they will sweep them up and take them outdoors.   The menu's are suuuuper dirty. They do not wipe them down at all! There's tons of grit and its sticky on all 3 of our menu's. The pricing wasn't too clearly shown. For the main's its all the same price located at the very top $16.95 and then you can add on your different meats for a dollar or 2 on top.   We got two appetizers the garlic shrimp and the fried chicken. They were both delicious!. For the mains the green curry was okay, we got it with beef. Big mistake, their beef is extremely tough! it was super dry, felt like it's been cooked for days and kept in the fridge to be warmed up in a microwave and tossed into the curry to serve. The 3 flavours pad thai was good. had a lot of flavour and ingredients as well. The best out of the 3 was the Khao Soi, i got that one with chicken. Delicious. No complaints.   We let the waitress know about the really tough beef and she just took the dish and brought it to the kitchen without saying a word. After a few minutes she came back and said she would switch the curry to chicken instead. We agreed and she took the plate back inside. It was a pretty busy night so taking awhile for the food to come out is understandable. I shared the Khao Soi and waited for the green curry to come out. By the time we finished our food it finally came. We just asked for it to-go.   The service i would say is about a 3.5, she seemed as though she was just rushing through everything without talking with the customers. Food took quite a while as well. I would go back to try their other menu items.",1
Been here multiple times   The staff here is very hospitable.  The aburi is what makes Miku Miku. A process of torching sushi. The ingredients are fresh and the pairing is great.   I like coming here for their cooked items as well. The dessert is a must !  Shout out to Dan the server for his service and recommendations. Hope to see you soon when restaurants open up again.  I heard they have takeout. I haven't tried it yet.,2
"I had Miku as a surprise birthday delivery (shout out to Kathy and Daisy if you're reading this) and loved this.  I got the Aburi Set + Green Tea Opera and was sad to see it disappear in front of my eyes as I took each bite.   The Aburi set was delicious but honestly, the memorable piece of this whole meal was the Green Tea Opera. I've never had something like it; the base was crispy/flakey, the chocolate was decadent, and the toppings made each bite a well-balanced meal.  If you had to order one thing from here, (yes I know it's a sushi restaurant), I'd actually order the Green Tea Opera over anything else lol.",2
"I've tried Miku for the first time in Vancouver for my birthday last year and I loved it! So when winterlicious 2020 came out, it was the perfect time to try their Toronto location. They were fully booked for their dining tables so we had to walk in and sit at the bar/high top tables. We chose to sit at their open kitchen and we quite enjoyed the view of the chefs preparing everyone's food!   For their winterlicious menu, we had the lunch tasting with an option for appetizer, main and dessert. I chose the sashimi selection with 6 pieces and feature kobachi. My boyfriend chose the Miku Zen - tuna crudo, panko fried scallops, truffle tamari Shoyu chicken, tofu salad. We both just shared our appetizers so we could taste more of their dishes. The sashimi tasted fresh and wonderful and their Miku Zen dishes was a good tasting experience. The ingredients they used blended well all together for each dish and I thoroughly enjoyed it.   For both our mains we had the Signature Aburi Sushi Plate - Salmon Oshi, Saba Oshi, Coal Harbor roll, Bincho Nigiri, Ebi Nigiri. My favourite piece out of the 5 given was the Ebi Nigiri...my gosh it was the best Ebi nigiri I've ever tasted! It was definitely very different from your usual shrimp nigiris that you would order at regular sushi AYCE restaurants. It melted like butter and the texture was very pleasant. I would for sure reorder it again when I come back to Miku in the future.   Lastly, for dessert we both ordered their Green Tea Opera dessert. The matcha ice cream was a nice pairing with the cake and I also loved the hazelnut wafer piece to finish it off! The server also recommended tea with the dessert to tie in all the flavours.  As for the service here, it's wonderful! Our server was great and they even have free coat check if there's no room to place your coat. After each course came out, the server also explained the dish and all the ingredients on the plate.   A great first winterlicious lunch experience at $33 + tax! Hoping they offer a summerlicious tasting menu, but regardless, I would love to come here again in the future.",2
"We were craving for good sushi during this quarantine and definitely Miku was a great pick! We got the Take platter and there were 36 pieces for 2 people. My boyfriend and I LOVED the torched sushi and the nigiri. The sushi was fresh and super tasty! I would say that the smaller rolls were a little disappointing though and I also found fish bone in one of them. However overall for $39, I would say it is a good cost. I would say that my favorite piece would be the torched salmon and the torched mackerel. I think next time, I want to order just the torched and special pieces more. 10/10 would still recommend!",2
"Once upon a time, I was really excited to try Miku when it finally came to Toronto. My friend ended up going before me and loved it, so we decided we would do -licious together. That was a disappointing experience so I never bothered going back. Overrated.    Fast forward a few years later and I'm back again for winterlicious but now it's $53 for dinner. I have to say Miku is consistent. I felt the same way about the food as I did the first time - mediocre. Expectations were met, but only because I was expecting much to begin with. We were seated near the front and had a view of the kitchen. I was initially shocked by the amount of kitchen staff I saw but I guess that made sense because it's a pretty big restaurant and there was a steady flow of people.     Signature Sushi Selection (Aburi Salmon Oshi, Aburi Ebi Oshi, Coal Harbour Roll, Red Wave Roll, Aburi Ebi Nigiri and ?) - Pretty cool that you get one of each because on their menu, you can choose only choose one type (nine pieces) for around $18. Unfortunately, the pieces were bland and the rice was a little hard, as if it's been sitting out for a while. When there was flavour, it was just the sauce. The best piece would be the Aburi Ebi Nigiri and the worst were the rolls. Very AYCE tasting tbh.   Sablefish & Lobster Ravioli - Love sablefish and it's pretty hard to mess up but this was probably the worst sablefish I've ever had. It was much firmer than I'm used to, as in when I smacked it with a fork, it didn't budge. I didn't like the lobster ravioli and there was a piece of shell in the filling. The veggies were flavourless and definitely an afterthought.   Green Tea Opera - It's a sever layer cake and each layer is different, though it really just tastes like chocolate and red bean. Cool, cool, cool, not important. The best part of this whole meal was the matcha ice cream. The texture was more like gelato imo, super smooth, next to no air pockets, very creamy. Perfect matcha flavour, strong in matcha but not bitter and just slightly sweet. Maybe because I just had it and it's fresh in my memory, but I think this might be the best matcha ice cream I've had.   Grapefruit Basil Smash ($7) - I liked this. Would describe it as sophisticated grapefruit juice. Stir well before drinking or you wont get the ginger beer/spiced honey part until later. Maybe it's the cup but it was a lot bigger than I thought it'd be.   No problems with the service. Bonus info, I overheard the table next to us ask the server for their version of a California roll and it sounds like they were able to accommodate.",1
"Ya know... My first Miku experience was during the spring on 2017 in Van City...I loved that city so much.  Our dining experience at Miku was the one meal that defined our trip.  Luck has it that Toronto, the sister city, has its own Miku.  Imagine the broad smile that crept on my face as I was researching eating options.  Given we only had a couple of days in the city, we meandered all over.  After a day of seeing Nathan Phillips Square and seeing Scotiabank Arena, we walked a few blocks further to Miku for an early dinner.  Oh, dude... The food was just as good as I remembered!  My fave was the Salmon Oshi Sushi.  We also ordered the Miku Roll.  It's named after the restaurant so it's gotta be good.  We loved everything on our table.  Another yummy meal thanks to the Miku staff.",2
"We have been meaning to try Miku. We somehow waited until Winterlicious, we were able to try a lot of items from the menu.   The presentation and quality of the food was just great. On top of the winterlicious, we got a miso soup each and an extra plate of sashimi.   Dan from Japan, took care of us that dinner. He is wonderful! Super funny and cheerful, Dan really made our night. Shout out to Dan!",2
Ordered the salmon lover and red tuna maki through Ubereats and unfortunately got food poisoning from my order.,0
"Winterlicious Dinner Review $53  Finally got to try Miku for their winterlicious dinner menu. For $53 you got an appetizer, a main and a dessert option.  Appetizer: Sushi Sampler - included some pressed sushi's (shrimp and salmon), two nigiris (shrimp and sea bream), and two pieces of rolls (spicy red tuna and a white tuna one). The sample was decent tasting. My favourites were the two nigiri pieces as they were very fresh and flavorful. The pressed sushi ones were okay as well and provided a more 'fusion' type sushi taste. My least favourite was the rolls. They tasted dry and bland to the point that it was hard to tell what you were sampling.   Main / Entree:  Sablefish and Lobster Ravioli with eggplant, mushrooms and romanesco.   I really enjoyed this entree. I though the sablefish was marinated and cooked perfectly. It was a perfect balance of sweetness and melt in your mouth smoothness. The lobster ravioli and cream sauce was amazing as well. You could really see and taste the quality ingredients that went into the ravioli with lobster meat on every bite. The accompanying vegetables were a little disappointing and very bland tasting. I felt like the romanesco and mushrooms were just blanched with hot water with no seasoning. It didn't really add to the dish, if anything took away from the other two tasty items.   Dessert:  Green Tea Opera Cake with Green Tea Gelato  The dessert tasted standard. I heard a lot of great things about this cake and was super excited to try it, but perhaps it was overhyped. I felt the cake part (chocolate ganache) overpowered the green tea flavour as opposed to complimenting it. But, the gelato was very delicious and pungent, which I enjoyed.  The service was great as usual. My only complaint was the fact that the women's bathroom always seems to be in disarray. I think more attention needs to be paid to it for this type of restaurant that thrives in the 'experience'. One stall was broken and there was toilet paper everywhere on the floor.   Overall, I felt that the food was decent, but perhaps the quality is not as high when it is Winterlicious? Mop",1
"Came here for the first time over a year ago, and came back recently and decided to treat myself to the Miku Kaiseki!! Miku Kaiseki is a five course tasting menu and we got to try everything from the sashimi, appetizers, filet mignon, their iconic aburi oshi sushi, and delightful desserts!!  First of all, their sashimi are so fresh and tasty! Also loved the presentation, they serve the sashimi over ice which was pretty cool and helps keep the sashimi colder.  The appetizers are amazing! Loved the scallop, prawn and oyster. I also NEED to mention how cute the plates they serve the appetizers in. Out of curiosity, we actually asked the server where they got them, and she said that they got it straight from japan which was very cool!  The filet mignon was HEAVENLY. The steak was so tender, it felt like the steak melted in my mouth! The roasted vegetables that were served with the steak tasted amazing with the steak.  Forgot to snap a pic of the aburi sushi, but in my opinion miku has one of the best torched pressed sushi in downtown toronto! Their aburi sushi never dissapoint as they're always top quality.  As for desserts, their signature green tea opera cake was amazing! It has a really nice matcha flavour and i loved the texture!  Service was also amazing, server was very helpful and friendly! All in all, it was an amazing dining experience and i would love to go back and try their other tasting menu!",2
"I wanted sooo badly to love Miku ...Because of the high ratings and I being a major sushi lover, I had very high expectations for this place. My overall experience was extremely underwhelming and disappointing.. The quality of the food is definitely not worth the price.  We ordered the anniversary prix fixe, signature sushi selection platter, beef carpaccio and tuna tartare. The prix fixe was OK.. quantity wise this one is actually worth the price as you get a lot of courses, but only the sashimi stood out as it was delicious and so fresh that it melted in my mouth! The sashimi is my favourite dish out of the ENTIRE meal... none of our other dishes stood out at all.. they did not taste fresh and to be honest, very bland. The beef carpaccio had barely any sauce on it but for some reason, had such a strong and weird after taste that my partner only managed 2 bites LOL. I've dined at many sushi restaurants and have had way better quality and fresh sushi for less than half the price at Miku..  Service was pretty good. Our server was very sweet, made sure our waters were always filled and checked up on us a few times. It was just a bit hard to understand her when she was explaining the food items due to her accent but its not too big of a deal..   I don't recommend and don't plan to return to Miku... so much better sushi out there at a far better price.",0
"Went here with my boyfriend for a date. They definitely live up to the hype! I got the chef select which comes with 3 small apps, a dessert and a mix of 12 individual sushi, Aburi sushi and roll. The appetizers were amazing! The stewed beef especially, was definitely worth trying. Each sushi piece contained an excellent balance of sauce, fish and rice. My boyfriend got the Salmon Aburi and the MIKU Roll. The MIKU roll was so soft and flavourful (it just melts in your mouth). The dessert that came with the set was a Green tea cake. It was light, flavourful, and a perfect end to our meal. I would definitely recommend getting one of the Chef select combos for a first visit so you can try a bit of everything they have to offer.   The service was excellent. The waiter took his time explaining all the ingredients in each piece of sushi and gave us great recommendations as it was our first time here.   It was an amazing experience, would definitely return for casual night out or special occasions!",2
"Food:  Have dined several times at Miku and the restaurant always delivers on a strong note. Dishes are well presented in a simple and elegant manner, and the desired flavour profiles are never hidden.   Have ordered the nine piece nigiri plate on several occasions. The paired sauces and garnishes are excellent while each piece is masterfully crafted. Personally, I also enjoy the pressed oyshi sushi, which is torched to caramelize the top layer. The sushi is also layered, which provides an optimal fish to rice ratio and creates a nice harmony of gentle acidity from the rice, fused with umami and sweetness from the fish.   For dessert, the Green Opera ranks among my favourite, if not, my sole favourite dessert in the city. The dessert features layers of génoise, chocolate ganache, sugar twill, hazelnut wafer, and green tea ice cream. The delectable finish always lives up to its name and provides a memorable experience that can cause even the most stringent calorie counter to transgress.  Atmosphere:  Very spacious for a Japanese restaurant, which ensures a relatively high level of privacy and consequently is frequented by a more corporate crowd. Decor is as expected and layout of the restaurant offers something for everyone.  Service: On point and as expected for a restaurant at this price level. Servers are descriptive and articulate in the knowledge of their dishes. Always satisfied with the level of service here.",2
"I first found Miku during summerlicious and I must say this is my favourite sushi place in Toronto!! The level of finess and creativity/artistry that goes into Miku's fusion sushi is amazing and honestly better than sushi in Japan. My favourite from Miku is their assorted sushi platter. There are 10 or so carefully crafted rolls with perfect seasoning in each for a burst of flavor in each bite. Their fish are carefully seasoned, and even delicious feel intimidated by raw fish because it doesn't feel fishy... if that makes sense.   Ever since, I have been back to Miku three times because I just can't get enough! I have tried their calamari, their specialty uni platter, and sashimi. The sashimi is also very high quality, tastes fresh and creamy.   Another hidden gem is their Momo sake (peach wine). I normally hate the taste of alcoholic drinks but I want to buy 10 bottles of this!! It's very very peachy and so delicious if you like sweet fruits and wines.   My recommended menu is $38 sushi platter and peach wine if you want to try Miku without killing your wallet!!",2
"Came here for Winterlicious 2020.  I really have to highlight how fantastic the service was! Our server took our plates in a timely manner after we were finished with each course. She also wiped down the table each time! The service was really on point!  We got the Miku zen, sashimi selection, kaisen don, signature aburi sushi plate, green tea opera, and passion fruit soy milk panna cotta. All the food was delicious!  The Miku zen had a wonderful assortment of items in it! Everything was unique and tasted wonderful on its own. The sashimi also tasted quite fresh and buttery.  The kaisen don had an absolutely fantastic assortment of sashimi! Every bite was essentially a whole new, delicious taste. The aburi sushi was super unique. Each piece was delicious with very distinguishable flavours. The desserts were both a wonderful finisher for the meal. The matcha in the green tea opera cake and ice cream was super concentrated. For comparison, it was not as sugary as Tsujiri but similar (if not better) quality. The layers of the green tea opera cake was really something--it had a great mouthfeel! The panna cotta was very light and refreshing as well.   Fantastic restaurant! I would definitely like to come back again, perhaps for a special occasion, as the prices are quite high. Their quality is definitely worth the decadence.",2
"Miku is a stylish and upscale sushi spot near the waterfront great for that special occasion. The place's self-proclaimed specialty is aburi sushi or flame grilled sushi which is indeed the highlight of the sushi menu. They offer a sampler of all the types of aburi sushi, which is 2 pieces each of the three different types of aburi sushi. If you're at all a sushi lover I would highly recommend trying them! The rolls are decent as well, although not particular too remarkable. The sashimi was fresh and presented nicely as well.  you're not a sushi lover, in which case I'd probably recommend going to a different style of Japanese restaurant, but luckily some of their entrees, in particular the sablefish is delicious.   Overall the restaurant is a nice spot for a fancy sushi occasion in an upscale location. The service was good, and the kitchen staff was actually rather accommodating for dietary restrictions and willing to make changes. However I would say that for the price, even for upscale sushi spots in a city like Toronto, you can probably get a more unique and memorable sushi experience elsewhere, which is what keeps me from giving them one more star.",2
"Winterlicious 2020 lunch $33  App: Miku zen (tofu salad, tuna sashimi, fried scallop, truffle chicken)   Main: Aburi sushi plate (5 psc - aburi salmon, aburi Saba, coal harbour roll, aburi bincho nigiri, aburi ebi)   Dessert: Green tea opera (cake and ice cream)  I've been to miku many times during the licious season and having tried both the lunch and dinner menu... I MUCH prefer the LUNCH over the dinner.  There are more variety in terms of the apps since I get to try 4 things! On top of that, the dessert is about the same for lunch and dinner. The difference would be portions in terms of main course. For the lunch menu, you only get 5 pieces of sushi which is def not filling for everyone, whereas for dinner you can choose to get the 5 pieces for app and have steak or what not for the main. However, I much prefer the MIKU ZEN for apps and I get a little taste of MIKU's aburi sushi. I came out full tho but I can't speak for everyone since we all eat diff portions.  All courses were fantastic - taste and presentation are ALL on point. However, as mentioned before, portion for the main is small... so not everyone will be able to get full from that. But I was VERY satisfied with all 3 meals and this is why I KEEP coming back to MIKU.   Staff was friendly and welcoming. I also love the interior design of Miku - very bright and lively! Miku has ALWAYS been my staple in terms of the licious selection across Toronto. Looking forward to summerlicious 2020 at MIKU!!",2
"I've been to Miku many times for work lunches, but this time I popped by for their winterlicious menu  which was $33 for lunch. The items offered were very similar to their regular menu, which makes this one of the better 'licious menus. I ordered the sashimi plate, the aburi, and their signature matcha cake as a dessert. The quality did not differ from their regular service which is always a good sign of consistency.   I gave it 4 stars because while it was good, it wasn't the best I've had at this price point. However, I would and do continue to come back as it is so central in the city. I definitely would recommend for first timers who don't want to break the bank for good sushi.",2
"Really delish sushi but OMG it's expensive.  I love sushi and I always try to find a great deal (not bang for your buck!).  The place truly is stunning and the service is excellent and the sushi is REALLY good but I wouldn't go back because the prices are very steep. I guess you are paying for the real estate (situated in a beautiful waterfront location).  You can easily walk down the street and find quality sushi thats a fraction of the price.   I highly recommend going here with a group of friends as this allows you to try and sample lots of different types of sushi, sashimi and other dishes that might seem interesting on the menu.  I had the 'Miki Signature Selection' which is what they are known for (Aburi Oshi).",2
"Miku is an excellent fine dining experience. Everything is immaculate from the food to the service. Plates are cleared promptly, utensils are changed and glasses are always full.  1) The aburi oshi sushi is a must - i love the salmon. Torched salmon and a jalapeno on top make for a perfect bite. If you haven't had torched sushi before, you must! It'll change your perspective on sushi. 2) And the true showstopper is their DESSERTS! I love the valrhona chocolate cake and the matcha opera cake. Whoever their pastry chef is, is a genius. Everything has the right balance in that it's never too sweet and the flavors are so complex.   Only one star off because the prices are steep, compared to new spots in the city that are popping up serving torched pressed sushi at better prices. I've been to the sister restaurant in Vancouver and quality is very similar. Great for an occasion like an anniversary.",2
"Best steak I've had in Canada and virtually everything else equally good.  Started with their famous Caesar Salad prepared tableside and it was as good as advertised.  The salad had an amazing amount of complexity, especially for a salad.  Very vibrant flavors.  It was also a huge portion.  Followed it with a Wagyu striploin from Sekai Ranch.  I had asked the waiter which Wagyu to go for and he enthusiastically recommended this one, was not at all disappointed.  I have not had much Wagyu so can't say how it compares but overall it was incredible.  A lot of flavor and melted in my mouth.  I also loved the creamed spinach, tasted more like gruyere than spinach, a big plus in my book.  Also had the sautéed onion but that wasn't as great as the other three dishes, not bad (and beautiful presentation) but not awesome.  Also had excellent service, overall a great steak experience.",2
"Came here on a Friday night. Not too busy.   The exterior of the restaurant looks like a huge storage box. Very rectangular. They have valet parking for $20. I think its pretty pricey since parking in dt toronto drops after 6pm, if you want to save some money, look for parking near the area!  Once you walk in, you will see the reception. It was a bit overwhelming for me, the waitress/serves were standing in a straight line, not talking, and looking at you. Felt a bit uncomfortable. Some people may enjoy this kind of service, i just felt like there were just way too many people standing and looking at you.   We were seated on the second floor. First floor is the bar area and where the pianist performed.   Second floor decor was very fancy but minimal, love it. We were seated by the window. The server came by, greeted and went over the menu with us. Do not hesitate to ask them if you have any questions, they are more then welcome to assist you and give you suggestions.  We ordered 2 drinks. Both very strong in alcohol flavors and less juicy or soday. Im not much of a drinker, so that was a bit too strong for me.  The bread came after. Huge, fresh, crispy but soft in the side. Looks like a muffin with a huge mushroom head. Love the bread. WISH there was more.   The salad came after. The caesar salad is made on the spot in front of you. I love the presentation but flavours wise, it tasted a bit too vinegar and lemony to me. Its not bad, but i had better 3/5.   The steak and the sides came.   We ordered the 30 days aged striploin from USA in medium. I felt like the exterior of the steak was a bit burnt, made the steak more on the chewy side. I love how they have 6 different condiments for the steak, recommend the soya sauce and the pink salt. Overall 4/5.   The mushroom risotto smelt super mushroomy and cheesy. Smell and appearance is 5/5. I just wished it was more creamy, the rice was a bit on the chewy side, maybe a minute or 2 longer in the sauce can make it softer and creamer. Still not bad! 4.5/5!  We ordered 2 sides, and the server recommended we do half side, which we did and super grateful because we were so full after. We had the Sauteed Rapini (the green leaves vegetable) and the potato grantin (potato sliced, and layered in cream and cheese). The rapini have some heat to it, its alright, nothing too too special 3/5. The potato was DELICIOUS, if you love cheese and cream, this is the dish for you! Super cheesy, flavourful, cripsy on the top, soft in the inside. 5/5!  Last but not lease, the dessert was a chocolate pudding, whipped cream with crushed chocolate and oeros on the top and bottom. I love dessert but not a fan of desserts that are too sweet. I thought this would be way too sweet for me, but it was in a perfect balance between sweetness and chewiness. LOVE IT! Just wish there was more. 5/5.  They even give you a small chocolate brownie, a cookie and 2 muffins when you ask for the bill. I was too full to even try the muffin. But overall, the experience was great. I just wish the steak was more tender and juicy and the caesar salad can be less sour or vinegary. Overall 8.5/5",2
Great food and amazing service. Loved every bit of it.  Patrick (our waiter) made the experience even better.  Worth every penny!,2
"A fine dining for really good steaks, wonderful service and  exclusive ambiance.   The servers are knowledgeable and well trained to ensure you have a great experience while you are there. The Sea Food Tower has a nice combination of fresh selections. The Snake River Wagyu is really great! Almost melts in mouth.   It is at the higher end on price. But the ambiance and quality makes it justifiable. They also have valet parking, which definitely makes life easy.",2
"I came here for my birthday celebration. It was a surprise, so I was super excited when we stopped by this place. As we walked in, you walk up a very instagram-able set of stairs. We were greeted promptly, and offered coat-check.  We got a table by the live piano. The piano playing added a nice ambience to our dinner. But I found the piano a little bit too loud at times, so it was hard to hear my date talk. But I did enjoy how he would play to the age group of the crowd. I didn't enjoy my 'sofa seat' that much because it was too low for me to eat properly. It sank in a lot as well.   Our server explained the menu to us, and recommend that we share a steak and order two to three sides.   We ordered: 14oz Creekstone Farm Prime Black Angus rib eye - medium rare $91 Table Side Caesar Salad - $26  Mushroom Risotto - $26 Duck Fat Fries - $17   Each table started with their house made brioche - which was crispy on the outside and fluffy and hollow on the inside. It also came with their garlic butter, which was buttery goodness.   Then came the Caesar Salad. The salad was more of a show where the severs would roll a cart of ingredients for the salad to your table and make it in front of you. It was a nice touch to see them make everything from scratch. The salad maker didn't really talk to us or try to make conversation so it was a little disappointing. (I saw the table next to us have a full on conversation with their salad maker).  The salad was good, but not the best caesar salad I ever had. It was a nice balance of cheese, and smoked bacon and a hint of anchovies. If you aren't the biggest fan of anchovies, you can ask for it on the side. I did find it a bit fishy at times.   Next, came the steak, which was cooked to perfection. I've never had such a tender and perfectly cooked steak. It was charred on the outside on an iron skillet. The steak came with charcoal salt, herbed salt, and pink salt (super fancy). All the salts tasted the same, salty. The steak also came with a chimichurri sauce, blue cheese and yuzu shoyu. I enjoyed the blue cheese the most. The salts and the blue cheese, brought out the beef flavour. Hands down, this is one of the best steaks I've ever had.  The risotto was good as well. My date didn't enjoy it as much, but I didn't mind it. But, if given another opportunity, we probably would have gotten something else.  The duck fat fries were amazing. Who would have thought fries could be cooked this nicely. Every fry had a good ratio of crispiness and fluffiness. The fries came with two sauces, their house ketchup and a garlic mayo.   We didn't get dessert, but the restaurant gives you a small tasting of their dessert free of charge. We got a small chocolate and a macaron. On the way out, they also give you chocolate muffins as a take-away. This was a nice touch.  Jacob's is definitely a fancier place. From the service, to the ambiance, decorations and even the bathroom, they make sure your visit is enjoyable. The server made sure to check up on us every so often, the water's were always filled, and our napkins were always folded if we left the seat. The elderly gentleman, at the entrance, even insisted in helping me wear my jacket  - even after I refused (I gave in).   I would like to come back and try their other steaks. There is a Wagyu Steak that costs $880 - out of my price range, but this gives you an idea of the type / quality of steaks they have.",2
"Definitely a bougie experience that was unlike any other! Yes, the prices are quite expensive, but the service is phenomenal. We sat in the piano lounge, and were definitely entertained by that night's performer. We were seated in the corner, along the couch - the sofa seats weren't particularly comfortable for dinner (they sank in quite a bit), but it added to the fine-dining atmosphere. The servers were also very kind and accommodated all dietary preferences (we had one vegetarian with us, and they would bring special orders to accommodate his restrictions, such as baguette with balsamic and olive oil to replace the popovers).  Each table is served complimentary popovers, one for each diner, topped with a thin layer of white cheddar cheese and served with roasted garlic butter. These legendary popovers are incredibly airy and light - we had to restrain ourselves from indulging on them in fear of spoiling our appetites for the mains. I preferred the harder shell of the popovers, though the inside is very buttery and rich. The garlic butter is quite flavourful, so take care not to add too much and overpower the bread!  Oyster rockefeller: My colleague put in an order for this appetizer, thinking they were your normal raw shucked oysters, and couldn't hide his shock when they came topped with a decadent, creamy, cheesy mixture. There was an interesting meatball nestled on top of the sauce. The oysters were quite rich, though I can't say I was the biggest fan.  Caesar salad:  We then ordered three sets of Jacob's famous caesar salad to be prepared beside the table. I was pleasantly surprised when the server came to the table and asked for everyone's personal preferences for their salad order (e.g., whether cheese or anchovies are okay, etc.). She then made the dressing on the spot - I saw her separate three egg yolks, then whisk thoroughly and combine with freshly cracked pepper, cheese, and a generous amount of olive oil. She then served each plate separately according to our liking - for instance, I didn't want additional cheese but chose to have an anchovy on top. I also noticed that she served me first, likely as I was the only female at the table.   As it was made in real-time table-side, the Caesar salad was unbelievably fresh. The crunchy, leafy lettuce greens were evenly coated with the creamy dressing. While good, I found the salad to be on the spicy side. The pepper added quite a bit of kick, with a slight bitter aftertaste. The anchovy imparted a pleasant touch of umami, but I thought the bacon was far too salty. There were square chunks of the hard cured meat which, interestingly enough, strongly resembled Chinese cured sausage.   The mains came next, served with an array of sauces (Argentinian chimichurri, Japanese citrus ponzu, a richer bacon & blue cheese) and salts (sea salt, regular salt, black lava salt). I preferred the ponzu, though the chimichurri was also nice, as well as the variety of salts. It's amazing what a simple seasoning can do to enhance the taste of the steak!  Queensland tenderloin wagyu: This steak was honestly very tender and super buttery. I barely had to chew; the meat would give to a slight push of my tongue and melt in my mouth. I've had wagyu beef before, but often more thinly sliced and prepared on a Japanese grill. It was my first time with a meaty seared piece prepared medium rare, and it definitely didn't disappoint. Definitely my favourite cute of the night!  Creekstone T-bone: I didn't have a good experience with this steak. My piece was actually terrible - it was near the edge, and was overcooked to the point where the meat proteins resembled tough pulled brisket. There was also a small amount of fat/gristle that made my mouth seize up. It wasn't a pleasant feeling, and I was very disappointed.  Striploin: This was a leaner cut of meat compared to the wagyu, though not as tough as the T-bone. Like the others, it was grilled to a perfect medium-rare, with rich and buttery flavours.   We also ordered a variety of sides to accompany our mains. The duck fat french fried potatoes had a very meaty flavour, and was a great carb to complement our otherwise protein-heavy meal. The mushrooms, carrots, and asparagus were all drenched in butter - this meal was definitely not for the faint-hearted! I was definitely very full and stuffed by the end, and regrettably could not order dessert.   The bill came with some small shortbread bites, a light sweet to signify the end of meal. We also received some massive breakfast muffins for the next day, a mix of coffee and chocolate filling. The meal was great, but alas, not perfect - perhaps my expectations were too high, but that one steak killed my vibe.",2
"Wide range of steaks, that takes your tastebuds for a journey around the world: Japan, US, Australia and even Ontario towns like Uxbridge and Guelph. We dined in the wine cellar, which has a clear wall peaking into the wine cellar and facing opposite their aging room.  First image: Wagyu (bottom), Guelph (top) with black volcanic salt, miso salt (brown) and sea salt. Each salt had a distinct flavour adding a unique twist to any steak. Sauces were fresh and diverse, chimichurri was my favourite for its fresh ""just picked"" herb taste, Japanese ponzu was a touch too salty, and the Danish blue cheese and bacon (I did not sample)  It's definitely not an everyday dinner, but for a corporate Christmas party or special occasion, Jacobs is a crowd pleasing spot for a delicious meal in a space that encourages learning the story of your meal.",2
"Mmmmmmmm no place better to have a steak in Toronto.  I came here for a celebratory dinner and we were put into the private room next to the wine cellar. It was very secluded, quiet and good for bigger groups.  When you're at Jacob's, it's mandatory that you get their Caesar Salad - it's unlike any Caesar salad you've ever had. Nonetheless, the spotlight is on the steaks. I didn't know the differences between them so I had the server help me out. I wasn't disappointed because we ordered 4 different steaks and I could taste the difference in each.  What an extraordinary experience to a carnivorous meal.",2
"Dining at Jacobs & Co was on my bucket list for a while so I was ecstatic when my parents made reservations here for my birthday dinner. Off of King on Brant Street, JCS is easily accessible by TTC. If you drive here, you can find some pockets of free parking or pay $20 for valet parking. From the outside, it doesn't look too big, but the restaurant is very spacious with three main dining areas. Service was excellent; the staff here know the menu well and leave nothing to chance.   Now to the food ... * Caesar Salad - it's made at your table. I never knew salad making could be an art, but JCS has proven otherwise. The final product was delicious and a 'must' if dining here. * Mussels - we enjoyed two types. * Bread - it came before the meal. Think the bread used for bread pudding, but with cheese baked on it. The garlic butter was a nice touch. * Steak - you can't go wrong. Let your server know your preferences and you'll be directed to a cut that you enjoy. I had the tenderloin from Argentina. * Lobster Risotto - I broke my 'no rice' rule for this. If I return, I can skip this dish. * Sides - We ordered mushrooms, rapini and fried potatoes. The fried potatoes were good, but nothing to write home about.  Overall, I had a wonderful dining experience. Hopefully there's something else to celebrate soon so I can return!   Good for: steak",2
"I'm not a steak person because I always have difficulty digesting beef and I don't like meat with too much fibre. However, my husband is a big eater and a big fan of steak. Therefore we came here to celebrate his birthday with my coworker's strong recommendation.   Although I purposely ate little for lunch before coming here for dinner, my stomach still felt quite uncomfortable (too full) after dining here. I will still try to write down some fair comments ignoring the uncomfortable part due to my weak stomach.  We ordered the duck fries and Caesar salad as appetizers. The fries tasted awful. Too oily and the oil was too old. However, the Caesar salad had decent portion and flavour too. The server made it from scratch right in front of us. The salad was a little bit on the sour end, my husband didn't enjoy it as much as I did (maybe because he had bad teeth sensitive to sourness lol?). For the steak, I got the 6oz Australian wagyu tenderloin. It was my first wagyu experience and it indeed tasted much softer than normal steak, though not wowed compared to the wagyu I had at other Japanese restaurants later on. My husband ordered the aged 25oz Tbone (yes he just eats that much!) and was very satisfied with the order. I generally don't like aged meat because of the fishy flavour but apparently this place is famous for their aged steak. To be fair, I would recommend anyone who's not against strong flavour of aged meat to give it a try. We also added a bone marrow on the side which was not good.  In general, this restaurant provided decent food with romantic ambiance suitable for special occasion.",2
"Steak - Order Wagyu - any other type of steak is just average here. We went for medium rare  Skip the duck fat fries  - less than average   My husband and I enjoyed the mushroom risotto and their chocolate dessert disappoint  Biggest complaint is that the steaks come out like warm and by the time you finish it, the steaks are cold which is a bummer   Servers were uber courteous though not friendly....  Pretty good steakhouse but hopefully this isn't the best TO has to offer...search continues",2
"I love this steakhouse! I brought my husband here for his birthday~ I've always wanted to try this restaurant because I've seen people post pictures and it makes my mouth water all the time!   We ordered the caesar salad as our appetizer to start off with. I find it pretty cool because they prepare it right in front of you at table side. The Caesar salad is nice and light! The sauce is just right! A teensy bit pricey for a Caesar salad - but worth it! We ordered the snake river farms wagyu - USA, 10 oz tenderloin and the 8 oz A5 black tajima- gunma prefecture - Japan California cut striploin.   The A5 black tajima was AMAZING!  A well marbled steak with rich buttery taste and texture - melts in the mouth! The best steak I've had so far in Toronto!   The snake river farms was good as well! But not as good as the A5 black tajima. The meat was tender and perfectly cooked at medium rare.   Overall, this restaurant was a great experience! The service was great, the setting and ambience were perfect. They even give you a muffin to go home with! I had it for breakfast the next day . It is a little bit on the pricier side, but totally worth it!",2
Finally had the opportunity to come here after hearing all the great things about this place. Very upscale and posh vibe.   Servers were descriptive with the menu and was very at tentative. Made great recommendations.  Oysters tasted fresh. Table side Cesar salad was great. Ribeye was well cooked but still tough and chewy. Wasn't particularly well seasoned which is why the side salt and sauces were provided. Could have lived without the rapini and mushroom. Bone marrow is a must.   Independently a very great experience but tainted from just coming back from Japan.,2
"A wonderful evening spent with the love of my life celebrating our one year anniversary which later converted to our engagement!  The surloin and toploin steak is definitely excellent, when you choose the right cut! The sides offered are also huge so beware when you order. The baked potato is especially large!  Service by staff is very good and the the only comment I'd make is about the cooling in summer as it felt rather stuffy inside.  Highly recommend for a special occasion!",2
"Taste: 5 Service: 5 Ambience: 5 Value: 5 Overall: 5  Hi and welcome to another episode of javing it with Javier. Let's see what we are javing today. To celebrate starting my new job my friend Daniel offered to take me out to a restaurant of my choosing. Obviously I had to choose Jacobs as I've been dying to try it after hearing it is arguably the best steakhouse in Toronto.   To start, we had the salad with crispy bacon and cheese topped off with an anchovie. The waiter made the salad right in front of us so it was an interesting watch. Then came the main course. We ordered the A5 Black Kagoshima striploin from Japan, the Canadian Prime High River Ribeye, the duck fat fries, and the creamed spinach. I have had Kobe steak in the past and that blew my mind. Although my mind was not blown to the same extent, I was delightfully surprised. The feeling of the melting fat harmonized itself perfectly with the taste of the beef. The 20oz ribeye was huge and was packed with juice. The fries and creamed spinach were also very good but my stomach was focused on the steaks.   The service here was unrivaled. The quality of service was equivalent to the time I tried out a three Michelin star restaurant during my China trip. The waiters were very friendly, helpful, and cleaned our table after every dish.  Just walking into the place I could feel how fancy it was. From the candle lit atmosphere, to the soft live performing pianoist in the background. I was almost going to pick my daily T-shirt with sweater combo when I was getting dressed in the morning. Good thing I wore something slightly fancier!  Although I really enjoyed my night and I would term this as a once in a lifetime experience, the cost of the meal was on the high side costing us a total of $520. Good thing papa Daniel got this one covered :P  In conclusion, I think this is the first review I gave a perfect score on. I would definitely go again but maybe for a very special occasion. I know the Japanese beef will be waiting for me. And that's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier. And remember food is life!",2
"I'm starting to notice a common trend among the top tier restaurants in the city. Not only do they serve incredible food, I'm realizing that the service they provide, just like their food, is top notch!  Came here for a birthday dinner and I have to say that the experience was excellent. I must warn that the bill can run up pretty quickly, but it's a definite try for a special occasion.   Our server was very professional who has been with the restaurant for 5 years. He was very generous and honest with us about not needing to order too much because portions were very sizeable and shareable. I wish I could remember his name, huge props to him.   We started with the table side Caesar, that is a must get. Got to pick the servers brain a little as well about what goes in to making a good Caesar. Very friendly with lots of Tips! Btw Don't use too much cheese, it will be bitter if you do.   We also got Canadian Wagyu which is seasonal from my understanding, who knew Canada had wagyu beef? We also ordered black angus from California. For sides we got bone marrow and also mashed potato. Impressed by how much flavour was in both of these sides as well, great quality.   The steaks were cooked to perfection with a whole lot of beefy taste to it. The crust on these things were incredible as well. I'd highly recommend the Canadian wagyu, full of beefy notes but also soft and tender when you bite in to it. Definitely worth the price!   I look forward to the next time i have an opportunity to dine at Jacobs!",2
"When going to Jacobs, you know you'll be getting the finest cuts of steak in town, attentive service, and a memorable experience. I can't say this second visit to Jacobs offered all of that.   PEI oysters: Great to start with - accompanied with hot sauce (not seafood sauce), black vinegar, and fresh horseradish. Fresh and high quality  Steaks: Very glad that our waiter was open to serving a Chicago style blue rare steak, which was finely executed (minus whoever cut open the steak to check how well it was cooked). The 45 day dry aged striploin was marvellous, perfectly and evenly cooked as expected. The waiter explained all steaks in good detail and helped us make a decision.   To finish: Without reminding them that we were celebrating a birthday, they decorated our dessert with was very thoughtful! Delicious muffins are given to take home, and small chocolates to end the meal.   The negative: Personally I did not like our waiter who seemed very ""pushy"". He would recommend drinks and desserts before we asked for recommendations, and made it very awkward to choose otherwise. Also he rarely made visits to our table, taking away from the experience.    Overall the ambiance is great, food is perfect, but service is not as professional as I would expect from one of the finest steakhouses in Canada.",2
"Birthday dinner for 10 Superb wine service with Riedel somm stems to accompany the top shelf wine we brought.  From their signature bread & the seafood tower to the risotto & steaks -including Aussie wagyu - everything was  perfect. We also ordered bone marrow and the must have Caesar salad. One of the tenderloins ordered was done medium, no problem, they replaced it and the medium steak was packed up in a doggy bag.  The seating area for 10 was also nice in a sequestered space with windows on both sides at a roundtable on the main floor.   A dining companion commented on dark chocolate pairing well with a bottle and it was taken care of.  Stayed there well past closing time and we were not feeling rushed in anyway.   I think this place is better suited for larger groups of 6-8 at least and no bigger than 10. There's a rectangular private dining area downstairs but you end up chatting with folks next to you given the size of the table.  Overall it came to around 450$ with tip and corkage (approx 2 bottles) per person, but was well worth it for a special occasion.",2
"Visited as a solo for a splurge dinner! Sat at the bar with the oyster station. Atmosphere was ok, food was good, service was great.  I kind of wish I sat at the bar I walked thru since there was live piano. Where I sat felt more like an upscale pub. Nothing wrong, but nothing tantalizing either. At the end of my meal there was a couple who joined and were the most obnoxious people...the woman behaved as though the entire bar was her living room. Perfect signal to wrap up my dinner and jet out!  Ordered a Caesar salad and an Australian steak that's the same breed as Kobe/wagyu but not raised in Japan. Caesar is made tableside. Enjoyed chatting with the server who was making it for me. The salad was good, but overly garlicky for me. I requested a palette cleanser afterwards as I was worried the garlic fire breath I had would distract from my steak! On a side...I breathed garlic all night even after brushing and swashing and taking a zantac antiacid and woke up with garlic breath the next morning! Tooo much garlic!  Steak came out cooked perfectly...medium rare. It was tasty, but it wasn't distinct enough that I would try it again because it was just Such an indulgence. The next time I would bite the bullet and order the authentic A5 Kobe wagyu steak.  Service was excellent. The waitress was knowledgeable, and answered all of my questions thoroughly. She patiently made excellent recommendations for wine...a white and a red for both courses in my meal. They were also able to offer 3 oz pours so I didn't need to have 2 full glasses of wine...which I did not want.   Dessert was a cheesecake which was an average  cheesecake and they were generous about addressing that. Cappuccino was good, but not strong or concentrated. This course was not steakhouse quality, but rather something I'd expect at a nice diner.   I wouldn't hesitate coming here again, but I felt in some areas it was more pretense than substance. I've eaten at Michelin star restaurants and Every part of the experience is excellent. Here it was good, but kind of spotty at times. Not worth the $300 price tag IMHO.  Thanks Jacobs staff for taking the time to walk me through your menu and help me narrow down the best steak for me. I appreciated the excellent service and hope to try another room and another steak when I'm back in Toronto in the future.",2
"Wow, what an experience this was. My boyfriend and I went here for our anniversary dinner and we were not disappointed. The place itself is beautiful with big and tall doors to greet you, it was a grand experience and made me feel important.  Once we were seated, we knew we had to get the table side Caesar Salad. While we were waiting for it to be made, they gave us 2 popovers with an herb butter which was tasty.  A server came by to make the dressing from scratch! Anchovies, raw egg yolk, garlic, and fresh parmesan cheese. It was cool to see them make it in a big wooden bowl. It was also served with crispy panchetta and complimentary white anchovies on our salads. This Caesar salad is the best I've ever had.  My boyfriend and I got the beef tartare for an appetizer. It was done so well that other beef tartares can't compare for my boyfriend. It was his first impression of beef tartare! I've had my fair share and I would have to agree.  We got the striploin that was aged 45 days and tbh I'm drooling a little bit as I'm writing this review. It was cooked to perfection, medium rare is what we like and that's what we got. Perfectly charred on the outside. For our side we got the potato gratin which was super tasty with all the melty cheese and creamy potatoes. They baked it which made the cheese that much better.  I told my boyfriend that it is a once a year treat but honestly I think I have to go back ASAP. Such an amazing dining experience.",2
"[Review was based on experience weeks ago]  This place is one of the first locations I have ever bookmarked on Yelp when I started my journey here. One time, my coworker asked me if there were any good places to eat for Chinese food and I remembered the amount of good reviews for this place and so I told him about it even though I did not have it yet. He told me the next day that he loved it!   After about 4 years of this sitting in my bookmarks, it was time to try it out. It was busy during the time we went and so that fueled our appetites even more. We got the beef ho fun, wonton soup and shrimp fried rice. I was actually amazed because the food came out relatively fast and that it was sooooo yummy. I usually do not eat Chinese food outside but this one is 100% an exception. Good portions with also good prices, indeed. I would totally come back to eat the same delicious dishes again. I am salivating as I look back at these photos....",2
"Swatow is a really good Chinese restaurant that I always go after studying in library they speak Cantonese and I love to talk to them in canto too! Much more fun that way!  And their servings are always pretty big but sometimes could be a bit oily(well, Chinese food XD) But it opened till very late(around 11pm I think?) so it's always suitable for ppl getting hungry late!",2
"The portions are huge. The place is in chinatown and is always busy. The food is your typical yummy, greasy, Chinese food.   We had the chicken fried rice and the shrimp noodles. Everything tasted really good",2
"Decent chinese food place  Inside is pretty packed. Our table was next to the washroom lol  The food is authentic. The portions are decent. Price is low, even when compared to similar restaurants in the area.  Cleanliness is ok. Staff friendliness is ok. They make jokes with customers. Overall a friendly environment.  Pretty decent place for chinese food. Will come back!",1
"This places is always busy and we finally had a chance to stop by without a wait.   This is very traditional home style noodle soup style. I thought that it was very reasonably priced and generous portioned. They have various different types of noodles: egg thin noodles, egg flat noodles, rice vermicelli, rice flat noodles, etc. These are available to mix and match with your choice of soup from the menu.   It's worth trying, especially on a cold winter day. We'll be back whenever we have cash (as this is cash only).",2
"Love myself some late night greasy Chinese food. A typical visit that will include the fried rice, beef noodles, meat dishes and stir fried veggies.  Their hot and sour soup was a little concerning though. It was more red as opposed to the typical brownish colour. There was no balance between the hot and sour - it was just sour. The only dish I would say to stay away from.  Cash only establishment.",2
"Clearly this place is very popular because there was a line out the door during prime time dinner. This disappointing part is the table set up. It's so packed. We couldn't get to our table without telling like two tables if they can move. In addition, we were very confused about the food options. We had to send our noodles back because it's not what we wanted. I asked to double check before that could happen  but I guess there was a miscommunication. Also i was not a fan of the chicken we ate. Tasted mainly like a lot of fat and breading. The second  pair of noodles we got were very delicious. Overall I'm not the biggest fan of the service and the food. Except the Lo MEIN, those were good Menu: General Tao Chicken Lo Mein Beef and Vegetables",1
"The food here is amazing. I understand why previous reviews mentioned it being an OG spot and authentic taste overall. They specialized in more FuZhou cooking but it's good cause it doesn't have the oily and greasy taste afterwards. We enjoyed everything we ordered and the portions were a great size for what we needed that day. They cook really good snow pea leaves, probably one of the best I've had in Chinese restaurants. So definitely no complaints about the food at all, it's totally worth it but CASH ONLY!   The only reason why I'm giving it a 3 is because they don't have the best table service (which seemed to be the case in the Toronto Chinatown area). The waiting staff look really annoyed at you and the lack of hospitality is not what I'm used to when I go to restaurants. Maybe the workers are being overworked and not compensated enough, just don't let it rub you the wrong way if you want to try the food, it does come out fast and I did really enjoy it.",1
"A classic Hong Kong style Chinese restaurant that opens til late, late at night in Chinatown. It might be open even when Google Maps says it's closed. And one very great thing about this place is its speed. The food is delivered within a few minutes from ordering most of the time.  I come here when ever I just want some Chinese comfort food or when every where else is closed. Their congee is usually good, not perfect, but its thick and creamy. Their beef brisket and tendons are usually on point, super tender and tasty. Their beef and bitter melon on rice is good with a bowl of rice. The sauce is a bit salty, probably expecting you to eat it with bland rice, but the bitter melon is cook quite well. Bitter melon is not for every one though because it is quite bitter. And the stir-fried pea tips are excellent too; it's a bit oily, but it tastes great with the oil. And the stir-fried rice noodles with beef is also nice; it's also very oily, but it tastes nice. I also love their clams with black bean sauce. There is a generous amount, and the sauce isn't either too starchy or watery.   Overall, I'd recommend coming here to get some classic Hong Kong style stir fries or beef brisket and tendons with noodles or rice.",2
"Swatow is an old school Chinese restaurant located in downtown Chinatown. It's been around for many years and have always been my go to stir fry noodles, soup noodles and various stir fried dishes that meets variety of tastebuds. My usual favorite is the beef brisket noodle soup along with their stir fried clams in black bean sauce.   This visit ordered the stir fried beef and vegetable noodles, beef brisket rice and fried tofu. All dishes tasty as usual. The fried tofu is a great value at $0.99 each and is fried crispy. A must especially if you can handle chili sauce to pair with it. Beef brisket dish was very saucy but meat usually more soft. Must be a off day.   Overall I'm always very satisfied with the food here. Customer service and cleanliness obviously not expected here but service is lightning quick as tables are turned over very fast. Opens late into the morning so anyone that craves for a late night snack can definitely come here.",2
"The restaurant is one of the older ones located in Chinatown. It was packed when I entered the restaurant. The restaurant itself is very limited in its seating, so in order to seat as many people as possible, I noticed the servers placing two different parties at one big table.   I ordered Beef Tripe Noodle Soup and my sister ordered the Wonton Noodle Soup. The noodle soup are filling in my opinion and definitely worth its value (under $5 without tax!). I tried both noodle soup and I preferred mine over my sister's. The tripe was so soft and chewy. As well, I liked the meat broth taste - a bit less bland. I also ordered the stir fried clams in black bean sauce and they were very delicious. I never thought of the combo of black bean sauce and clams, but they complemented well and a definite must-try if you like clams. I recommend this restaurant- definitely worth the money for their food.   However, disclaimer is that they ONLY ACCEPT CASH.",2
"Noods, noods, noods! Swatow has all the noodle options and you can't go wrong with any!  Tried the egg noodles with shrimp wontons and shrimp dumplings. The noodles are chewy, the soup comes out hot and the veggies are cooked to perfection. The wontons are a must!  The majority of the tables were taken the few times we popped in. There's a wait if you don't want a shared table, but doesn't take more than a few minutes since most seem to be in and out and they're very quick with service.",2
"And still and absolute belter of a Chinese, the best beef in black bean sauce in the city!  I always intend to try something new but always end up with this and shrimp fried rice - great comfort food.",2
"Stopped by this restaurant with my parents for nostalgic reasons. They both raved about it being the best place for noodles since they were in high school. They said it's one of the few places that had authentic Shantou noodles. So we tried the noodles with fish slices, fish balls, and beef brisket. The noodles instantly reminded me of the ones I had in Chiuchow and Shantou, which I still dream about. The broth was light, the noodles were cooked firm, and the fish balls were flavourful. The beef brisket was tender and juicy. Although these noodles can't exactly replicate my experience back in China, it did hit the mark! After finishing our noodle bowls, we also took out some fish balls to cook at home. It was such a satisfying and comforting meal. Looking forward to coming back for more noodles!",2
"Famous Noodle and chinese dishes place located china town of Toronto. Food are prepared authentic way and ingredients are fresh. Good portion dishes. Just the restaurant is not big and crowded, because it's always lots of customers. Their famous food is 汕頭魚蛋粉 Shantou style fish ball noodles  and l saw lots of customers order deep fried chicken wings, looks great too! I will try on my next visit  recommended   Open till 1am, good choice for late night craving",2
If you haven't heard of Swatow or haven't been yet you totally should. While not totally vegan this is another location in Toronto where you can get some Chinese style food that is vegan. The portions are huge and it's very inexpensive for what you get and it will not disappoint your taste buds.  Be prepared to wait a bit to get in. This is a very small place and can be very busy especially during standard meal hours. The staff were friendly and super accommodating to us. They mainly have small tables but there are a few bigger ones. If you have a fairly large group of say more than 5 people you might want to reconsider if you all want to eat at once and sit together. This is great for small groups or even the solo diner. It was actually so busy when we went that we wound up sitting at a bigger table with other diners which was a lot of fun actually.   No matter the shortcomings of this establishment once you try the food it will all melt away and you'll actually wonder if it even matters. Just go I doubt it you'll walk away without wanting to come back.,2
"One of the OG restaurants of Toronto's Chinatown. It is a classic ""hole in the wall"" that has stood the test of time. The surrounding area is slowly but surely undergoing gentrification.  I remember a lot more Chinese supermarkets and aunties selling vegetables and other items along the streets.   The restaurant is small and cramped. If you have a seat near the kitchen doors, be prepared for the stench every time the door swings open. You don't come here for the ambiance/service. You come here for Chinese food.   Washrooms are in the basement, as with most restaurants in the area.   Service is as expected from a Chinese restaurant. Effective.   Ordered: ""Fish sliced noodle soup"": I chose vermicelli, which is thin rice noodles. The ""fish sliced"" is actually a blend of mystery fish made into a cube pre-cooked and sliced. It's probably the same item used for hotpot. Instead of this topping, I'd recommend the fish balls (you really taste the ""fishiness"").   The soup is clear and very mild in flavour. It's not overly salty. A plus is the vegetables that accompany the soup.   Observing the other tables' chow meins, rice dishes etc., I believe Markham Chinese food / Congee Queens provide much better value (quantity:price ratio)",1
"Toronto has a Chinatown, bakeries, small businesses, restaurants and more. Always ask locals for recommendations and our Lyft driver lead us to Swatow. This authentic Chinese cuisine was great. We had a wait ( don't arrive hungry), and we ordered enough food for the two of us, the table next to us had a 7 person group, the more the merrier aka try more menu options. The clams in black bean sauce were my favorite.",2
"Toronto has an authentic Chinatown. Though not quite as vibrant as San Francisco or New York, we found a very good place to eat.   The won ton soup was plentiful and filled with fresh bok choy and too many noodles to eat. Three of us shared this. Then we had the general tao chicken which was tasty but not overly spicy. And had a sliced beef over rice dish which was also flavorful.   All in all much better than we can get in Detroit. We enjoyed the meal and would come back but wouldn't feel like we had to come back.",2
"Definitely one of my favourite places to go for some quick, cheap eats  I got the Shrimp wonton noodle soup for about $7. Broth is not too greasy, tasty and came with 5 wontons and some veggies  Ambiance was just like any hole in the wall Chinese restaurant  Service was just like any other Chinese place, non-existent but understandable. You write down your order on a sheet of paper and after the waitress gives you a meal, they leave you alone. After they see you're almost done, they'll give you the bill with 2 fortune cookies. Just a heads up, they also only take cash.",2
"Service: Excellent. We were greeted and taken to our table,  where we were offered coat check,  which is a nice touch,  especially in winter!  Our server is a legit sommelier, which made her wine recommendations fantastic and trustworthy.    Highly recommended reservations for this place.  We had a 6pm reservation and the next party, wasn't coming until 830, which gave us plenty of time to talk and enjoy the food.   Food: tasty! We ordered the sweet n sour pork hoc , which was soft and easy to eat.  Im not a fan of eating fat,  but this I thoroughly enjoyed.    We also had the deep fried trout and octopus tacos.  Both very good.   The desserts however,  I found too sweet.  We had the date cake and chocolate chomparado.   Food came out quickly which was nice too :)",2
"DaiLo was recommended to me by a Toronto local and albeit the pricey small portions, I'm glad I gave this place a try. I mean...truffled fried rice, brown butter potato dumplings, octopus/pork belly daikon tacos?? This place knows how to elevate Asian flavors!!  The above were my favorite dishes that we tried but along with those, we also had the pork wontons and the brussel sprouts. I am a HUGE brussel sprout fan and loved this dish but found it quite interesting to be topped with shrimp floss and smoked trout.  Definitely make a reservation here if you go! We got here at 5:30pm right when they opened and seats were already limited.",2
"Small portions, and flavors weren't very exciting for ""upscale fusion"". Seemed pretty typical Asian.  Staff was good and attentive.  All in all the atmosphere and experience felt very pretentious.",1
"We came here for a date night and was blown away by the service and the food. I walked in thinking it was just every Asian fusion tapas restaurant but was pleasantly surprised with each dish.  To keep things interesting, we had the tasting menu and had dishes that weren't on the menu like the Big Mac Bao - which was delicious and you know, tasted like a Big Mac with that sauce.  My favorites of the night were the Hakka Wontons, Ontario Pea Dumplings and oddly enough, the corn soup starter they gave us to kick off the meal.   I was completely stuffed at the end until the manager came over and served us a White Rabbit Ice Cream in basically a bowl of chocolate goodness. I will actually come back just for that dessert if it was on the menu - I was mind blown.  The only thing I would change is that instead of ordering the Giggling Trout, get the Duck instead.",2
"Good food and unique flavours but found it a bit pricey for whats it worth. Came here on a Sunday evening to a somewhat empty restaurant that filled up slowly throughout the night. Dishes were flavourful but expensive. The portions are also quite small so if you want to fill up, you'll need to spend quite a bit. I may personally struggle a bit with fusion Chinese restaurants as I often find similarily tasty food for significantly cheaper in traditional restaurants.   Worth a try but I won't be a regular!",1
"Chef Nick Liu is a staple here, and he and the staff helped to seat us as they opened the restaurant. Now that is what you call service.   My wife and I, as well as my brother brought my dad out for a belated father's day as he wasn't feeling well the week of.   We tried to be a mix of adventurous as well as somewhat safe to see if I couldn't get my dad to enjoy the meal: mission was a minor fail  We started with the Fried Watermelon. It was a weird and interesting experience for the table. The warm juiciness of the watermelon against the herby basic and acidity of the pickle and the porkfloss added some salt a difference in texture. This was a fun dish that played with the temperature, and different flavours.  The Burmese Tofu arrived around the same time. The chickpea texture stands out in this tofu and really fits with the spicy mixture of the duxelle and chili. This mixes that familiar tangy-spicy mixture you'd be used to in other Asian dishes with a different take on a tofu. It was quite enjoyable, heat levels would not be appropriate for those who are spice aversion.  Our Third Starter was the. Ontario Pea Dumplings. I enjoyed the duality of the mush pea filling of the dumpling and the springy full pea that decorated the dish. I'm not sure I'm a huge fan of the truffle here. I feel like it takes a bit away from the peas but it added a punchy earthiness to the overall dish a long with the other mushrooms.   We ordered the Truffle Fried Rice and Jackfruit & Chili Glazed Back Ribs. The rice was your standard friend rice but with that punch of truffle, its not as strong as I've had with other fried rices with truffle. The ribs were tender and fall off the bone. Its not sweet or spicy in any regards but still tasty all the same.   The chef sent out palate cleansers, in the form of sorbets. I forget the flavour.  We also got the Soju Poached Pear for dessert. The pear retains that bite in the texture while being tender enough to cut through with a spoon. The nuts and the ice cream help to round out the dish emphasizing the sweetness and the crunch of the dish.   I would love to explore the menu again or to try the tasting menu. I enjoy the difference that is represented in Chef Liu's dishes and can't wait to try more.",2
"Very pricey very small portions but good atmosphere, services is pretentious but ok. Good place for drinks and what feels like tapas.  Good place for an expensive date, most plates enough for 2 ppl only.   Plates to try: fried rice, whole fried fish, jelly slaw,   Plates to skip: fried watermelon sound cool but just warm cubes of water lemon, ribeye (meat was tough), duck meat was also tough,   We ordered 3/4 of their small menu. They don't have all the items pictures on yelp.   They have an excellent bottle of white wine, Chasselas I think from France? Yum.   BEWARE: we found that the prices they charged on our bill was different and higher than the prices listed on their menu ??!! Shady right??! How does that even happen?? Our bottle of wine was listed for $75 and they charged $85 and a few other other items too, $38 listed charged $40 etc.  We verified the wine and they admitted their fault.  We let the other smaller differences go but SHADY BUSINESS PRACTICE OR INCOMPETENCE?!   Just REMEMBER TO CHECK AND DOUBLE CHECK YOUR BILL. ITS SO EXPENSIVE ALEADY so I guess most people just assumed it was accurate.",1
"Where do I start with this place. It's Asian fusion done really well. My friends and I booked a table here way in advance. We came here for dinner on a Saturday night and it was complete packed. We ordered the fried watermelon, lobster over a bed of noodles, truffle fried rice and duck over dark blue pottato salad.  Food here is pricey, but the portions and service here is great. We literally devoured everything off our plate. The breading on the watermelon and the soft texture inside is a must try. The ginger scallion lobster over some fried noodles provided a nice crunch. The duck was cooked perfected all the fresh veggies played by it complimented the dish very well.  Overall the food was really good. 4 entrees was plenty for 4 people. I'd highly recommend what dishes are specials and off menu. The lobster was not on the menu but we'll worth it",2
"2.5 stars. Nice casual ambiance. The tasting menu is around $190 for two, after tax and tip. I was let down by the food. They have a tendency of using very strong flavours that were overwhelming and competing with each other.  For instance, the pea dumpling had black truffle, bone marrow, and bacon. I wish I could have tasted the pea filling and bone marrow more because that was quite delicious, but it was overpowered by the more dominant flavours.  The wontons in sweet chili sauce was my least favourite dish. It was way too sweet (desensitized my tasting buds for the next dish), and the wonton wrappers mushy and falling apart.  The tacos were doused in aioli and it made the whole thing just taste like spicy mayo.  The fresh leaf wrap was very good and texturally interesting.  I didn't think the tofu ""cheese"" Caprese salad was anything special, but the tomatos were nicely peeled to soak in the dashi.  The smoked duck is a smart menu item because it can be prepared ahead of time and has a longer shelf life, can be served cold (well it was served cold to us so I assume that's intentional). The downside is that the fat is not rendered at all. and cold duck fat can be very rubbery. The skin was also unpleasant. It was not similar to a duck prosciutto where the fat is tasty and thinly sliced. The purple potato mash was very boring.  The ""famous fried rice"" tasted purely of black truffle oil, so if you like truffle you'll enjoy this. Thankfully there were no other competing flavous. I didn't think it was special. I think dousing things in truffle oil is a bit of a copout.  Our server was very nice, but he was quite busy. We had to wait a long time for water sometimes, and the sparking water cups are so tiny that I was constantly running out. No  pitcher or bottle for the table. Time between dishes is also long.  Overall I don't regret coming here, but I'm not sure if I'd come back. The value for the quality of food was not worth it for me. It certainly was interesting to try once.",0
"One of the few restaurants I was most excited for but was left the most disappointed... Based on the reviews and pictures I came here with high expectations, unfortunately my experience was very underwhelming.  My friends and I ordered the crispy octopus tacos, hakka brown wontons, torched tamari glazed beef carpaccio, sichuan braised beef and the whole fried giggie trout. My table all agreed that the tacos were delicious and the best out of everything, and since this was the first dish brought to us we had very high hopes for the rest of our dinner.   The rest of our food were just mediocre - it wasn't BAD but it wasn't to die for either. It honestly tasted like stuff we can make at home, which some people may not mind but my friends and I were expecting the fusion tastes to be more noticeable and long the lines of tastes we've never tried or experienced. The flavours/tastes didn't compliment each other or stood out to us at all, so we didn't really experience the ""fusion"" in any of the dishes except for the tacos.   Some of the criticism agreed by my entire table for certain dishes were:  - the braised beef tasted exactly like the beef in pho, which is weird because the seasoning is completely different - the wontons were a bit too salty  - the trout was a bit too oily for us - not enough sauces on the beef carpaccio, so it was too plain  Not only were the tastes not there, the portions were ridiculously small for the price (especially the tacos), aside from the trout. We usually order the same amount of food for 4 girls elsewhere and never finish - we finished all of the food here and were still hungry! Our final bill was $200 on the dot after taxes which is supposed to be AVERAGE I guess... but not worth it at DaiLo because we weren't full/satisfied. I feel like we could've spent the same amount elsewhere and gotten a better experience with food and actually be full afterwards.   Despite the food not meeting our expectations, service was outstanding and impeccable. Our server was very patient with us and answered all of our questions, and explained each dish that came out beautifully. Our waters were always filled, and dishes were cleared quickly so our table was never too crowded. It was very quick to get his attention too when needed.   Would I come back? Most likely not. I applaud DaiLo for trying with the the whole fusion scene but it just didn't work for us. The ""fusion"" additions they tried weren't enough to make most of the dishes stand out to us, the dishes tasted far too familiar at home... Sucks because we all really wanted to like this place!",0
"Had chef's tasting menu($65), which offers variety of dishes to try. It's a great way to explore.  Food worth mentioning: fired watermelon, fired fish(taste a bit oily at the end), pork belly  The noodle with boiling oil pouring from the top taste too salty and the noodle is hard.",2
"Picked up bae from school figured we eat downtown since we rarely get the chance. Came here in hopes they had the Peking Duck like at little DaiLo and previous reviews also said they did (1 review from a year ago to be exact) sadly they didn't but still had a pretty good late dinner.   Service was spotty, it was the end of the night we were one of the last tables to walk in, understandable. The basis were covered but wasn't anything spectacular.   Ordered 3 dishes, truffle fried rice, dry aged ribeye, and the beef tataki/tartare..? cant remember.   truffle fried rice was PACKED with umami flavour and the side xo sauce enhanced the rice to a new level, I should've asked for more of the it.   dry aged ribeye steak was also tender as fffffffff, cooked perfect medium rare and pre-cut just the way I like it. Sauce on top was alright a little too tangy and sour for the girlfriend, I didn't mind it but could've had it on the side and wouldn't have cared about it either.   the beef tartare or whatever it was, wasn't too memorable would've rather had a different app but wasn't a bad dish either, 3/5.   I'll come back for the fried rice and try other things in the future but it was a tad expensive. in my opinion this is the type of place you go once and a while when you wanna splurge.",2
"Dailo's tasting menu is hands down the best meal I've ever had in Toronto. Period! This is solely my opinion, as someone at the table beside me actually LICKED their plate. Yup, I saw that!   We came to Dailo on a Saturday night to celebrate a birthday. I called a week in advance to book a table for Saturday night and if you plan to visit, I suggest you do the same. It gets packed! I specifically requested the corner table by the window to get a little more privacy, as the seating arrangement is very tight.   We knew that we wanted to try the tasting menu, given that we've never been to the restaurant before.  It did not disappoint! For $65.00 pp, we received a total of five courses each (10 in total), plus a refreshing dessert. The tasting menu changes with every visit, but the wait staff was kind enough to fulfill our  request of trying certain dishes (I.e. fried watermelon). Skip through the next couple of paragraphs to find out what the tasting menu consisted of, otherwise, stay for my rambling.   The drinks menu is a little restrictive for those who may not want to order an entire bottle. There is an extensive wine and sake list, with only several options that are served by the glass. I'm a huge fan of orange wine and I was disappointed to find out that it was only served by the bottle. Nevertheless, there is a great selection of cocktails, beer/ciders, and spirits that provide a single serving.   The decor of the restaurant is whimsical to say the least. From the outside, it has the aesthetic of a century-old storefront, whereas the inside is an ironic take on a 50s Hollywood movie about the ""Far East."" Given the precious name of the restaurant, this was surely done with sarcasm in mind. The bathrooms are tiger balm scented (no, I'm not joking), which again plays with nostalgia and irony all at the same time.   The tasting menu blew us away! The entire dining experience took about two hours to complete and we never felt rushed. Check the photos for all the dishes that were included in the tasting menu. I will be surely returning!",2
"[4.5/5 STARS] TLDR: HUGE FAN! My boyfriend brought me here for our one year anniversary dinner. Fave thing I ate here was the deep fried octopus tacos. The jicama shell was the most interesting take on a taco shell I've ever had.   We started off with some house cocktails. I one that tasted like gin and he got the one with scotch. They were okay.   The food on the other hand. Delicious! We couldn't decide which dishes to try, the waitresses and waiters were really helpful they suggested the tasting menu which is $68/person and made up of 5 courses of the Dailo's ""greatest hits"" - popular items on and off the menu. Probably the best decision we made. We made sure they knew my dietary restrictions and we were good to go!  They started us off with two amuse-bouche's which was a like a yam dressed in sake. So good! Next course was the Crispy Octopus Tacos (my fave!!!) and Pomelo Betel Leaf. I love the freshness of the lemon grass and the contrast with textures from the nut crumble. Third course was an carnita empanada with satay sauce (not on their current menu) and this tofu tomato salad that tasted like a play on a dairy-free (no mozzarella) caprese salad. The dough for the empanada was sweeter than i was used to but the sauce was so savoury! It made the dish for me! The tofu in the salad was prepared in a way to almost taste like the texture of cheese. It was very interesting and tasty as well. Fourth course we were served their Ontario Pea Dumplings (with truffles) - so rich so heavy so savoury very yummy - and their Hakka Brown Wontons. The sauce with the almond crumble on the wontons was to die for! The wontons themselves tasted so homey. I loved it. Lastly our fifth course was the lamb and sticky rice dish that came with a slaw (so good!!!) and the beet coconut curry dish. By the time I was done with the huge piece of lamb I didn't even have enough room to really enjoy the beet coconut curry. I liked them both though. They finished us off with a ginger sorbet palette cleanser. It was a lot of food for $68/person. I think if you have an appetite this is a great value for the quality of food you get.   The only criticism I had was that at the end of the meal everything was starting to taste like betel leaf - that minty peppery taste - they had used it chopped up in most of the dishes they served us. The dishes on it's own with the betel leaf were delicious if we ordered that solely, but as a tasting menu, it was sort of overplayed all together.",2
"One word - Amazing.   I got the tasting menu and was absolutely floored. A great fusion of various Asian influences and still stayed traditionally Chinese. Bold flavors and super balanced with fun textures.   Go for the tasting menu but if that seems too much Is recommend the truffle fried rice, all the dumplings, octopus taco and their drinks!",2
Cool little Asian fusion spot in Toronto.  Came here with a group of 4 and we got the lobster and duck to share.  It's a bit pricy but the food was amazing and we were all full afterwards.  We also got the fried watermelon as an app and it was just as good as it sounds.,2
"Dailo is a unique, great restaurant.  It's typically possible to get a table within an hour of showing up, they have a patio right in collage.    What I really like is the unique dishes. Everything has lots of thought and work put into it.   My only negative is that they have too much fried food.  Otherwise the menu and quality is fantastic.",2
"We happened upon DaiLo during a visit to Toronto and it easily became my favorite meal of the trip. Everything on the menu looked incredible so we opted for the six-course tasting menu.   Texture was at the forefront of this meal; every dish had a lovely dynamic of ingredients. We started with a bite of squash soup and a betel leaf with puffed rice. We then had the octopus tacos (must get!), which were wrapped in a thin slice of jicama instead of tortillas. That was followed by a delicious soup with scallop ceviche -- I wanted to drink the broth. Pea dumplings with truffles were exquisite. The beef with gnocchi wasn't a highlight for me but still was a solid dish. The meal finale was an entire fried trout with a zesty salad. I normally would have been too intimidated to order such a dish, but this was spectacular.   For ~$60, this was an incredible value, with every single dish being quite impressive and unique. Service was excellent, I really appreciated that each dish was explained as it came out. Would 100% return.",2
"Delicious experience and the chef's ability to execute on Chinese fusion is totally on point.   To me, this place told the perfect story of childhood nostalgia and modern French cuisine.  We made reservations via telephone, but you could also do so on OpenTable.   Service was fantastic and ours really knew is stuff when telling us about the dish being served.   Wife & I ended up going with the Dailo's Choice  chef's tasting menu ($65 pp) and were not disappointed! We asked if we could have a few must-have items as part of it, and they were happy to accommodate! Amazing!  To me, the most memorable & nostalgic dish was dessert. It was a Pandan and, wait for it, WHITE RABBIT CANDY icecream with tumeric crisps and some sponge cake. Apparently it was the winner of an internal dish challenge amongst the cooks 2 days ago and it totally blew our minds! Amazing for them to do this and so glad they did!  The amuse bouche was some sort of soup with sesame oil, while don't remember what it was exactly, was so flavourful to start the meal!  Other dishes that were very notable and highly recommend are octopus tacos, truffle fried rice with homemade XO sauce (the XO sauce is amazing), fried watermelon (something unique and yummy), smoked duck platter (so many different flavours & textures!), Melt in your mouth pork hock, and their interpretation of turnip cakes.  All in all, delicious experience and really enjoyed the tasting menu.  When we return, we'll probably try Al a carte to try a few more other dishes. But if it's your 1st time, you can't go wrong with the Dailo's Choice.",2
"I had heard a little buzz about Dai Lo from some friends visiting from out of town. They raved about their Chef's menu and I knew I had to try it. I made reservation a couple days ahead of time... for a Wednesday dinner. They had no problem fitting us in.   My first impression was a classy fusion between asian and western decor. Cozy, and not at all pretentious. I had to wait about 20 minutes for my friend, but I ordered myself a cocktail. The staff were polite and didn't give me a hard time about not being ready on time.   We selected the Chef's choice menu and we had absolutely no idea what an emotional, and gastronomical adventure awaited us. If I go over my photos, I think I can count 11 separate dishes. Some small, some sizeable... all unique and heavenly. All of that for $67 pp?!? It's a steal.  I am not going to describe all the items, because I don't want to spoil it for you (and I don't recall). I really appreciate that they check for allergies and general dislikes before you start ordering. They explain each dish carefully and give you enough time between the dishes to savour and enjoy every bite.   If you are not able to finish the last few dishes, they will pack it up for you. Left over fried rice + braised beef for lunch...mmm  Just like this review, I can ramble on about Dai Lo and not make any sense. I highly recommend you experience it for yourself.",2
"I love this place! Really hits the spot for some chinese fast food/afternoon snackies. Might be a bit hard to find, they usually have a sign outside with their specials and you have to walk up a flight of stairs to get to the actual restaurant.  My personal favourite is the pork chop baked rice - I pretty much get this every single time.  They have everything on the menu from fries and chicken wings to fried rice to baked oysters. If you can imagine it, they can probably make it! They also have a bunch of daily specials that also come with a soup (either cream or borscht) and I think a drink included in the price - a pretty good deal if you want something more plentiful.",2
"Just prepared that you may wait more than 50 mins for food serving. i came here twice. each time me and my friends will waiting more than 50 mins for food after we ordered. no matter how many customers in here. they are always very slow. even fried rice, they will take that long.  And the fried rice. Are not totally sauced... even it took 50 mins to make.",0
"Food: 4 Stars Service: 4 Stars Ambience: 3.5 Stars Fill Factor: Stuffed  I must have passed by this place for a very very long time but did not know anything about it until recently. The restaurant is on the second floor of one of the buildings on Dundas and aside from the big hanging sign outside I did not really notice it was there. After finally trying this place I am kicking myself for not coming here sooner.  The menu was fairly extensive and ranged from lighter options such as sandwiches to HK style milk tea to pork chop rice. The best way to describe the food at Hong Kong Cafes would be filling, inexpensive comfort food. There were several items I wanted to order but decided on the pork chop with tomato sauce and rice (you have the option of rice or spaghetti). The waitress also brought me a bowl of hot soup to start which was great. When my rice arrived I was happily surprised at the portion size and how delicious the food looked. I quickly dug in and was very pleased with the taste of the food. The tomato sauce was plentiful and a bit sour like I prefer and the pork chop was nice and crispy on the outside. It was an enjoyable meal and I was stuffed when I was finished with the food.  The service was good here as the staff were all friendly and checked in on me often. Many of the people that came in seemed to be regulars so there was a lot of friendly chit chat between the customers and the staff which gave the place a friendly vibe. The restaurant itself is not overly big but offers a fair amount of seating. The place feels clean and the seats were comfortable.  I am glad I finally gave this place a try as I really enjoyed the experience. I look forward to my next visit and will hopefully I will be more hungry so I can try more items on their menu.",2
"This place has had its changes, I haven't been here in a while and it has drastically improved in the modern era look. Everything is well up to date in terms of presentation. I just got my regular Hong Kong beef spaghetti noodle. Tasted great as always, nothing has changed since the last time I've been there. Definitely a cheap place to get your food fix. Will come back when I'm in the downtown Chinatown area. The establishment is on the second floor, if you have mobility issue it is going to be difficult to get up to the second floor.",2
"I have been here a few times. I don't know much about Hong Kong style food, but the food here is really good. I am pretty snobby with Chinese food and this place is one of the few places I will go to. The first time I went I was a little scared because it felt very bare-boned/sketchy but get past that and you will have some great food. The staff was very accommodating of our request for vegetarian options. Great food and staff. Note that you have to travel up a steep set of stairs to get to this second floor restaurant so not accessible and you'll have to fold up that stroller to bring it up.",2
"Cheap & Chinese Version of 3 Course Meal Great value for food  Location: 2nd floor on top of a store on Dundas, a bit hard to find Food: 4/5 Service: 3/5 Decor: the restaurant is pretty nice renovated and clean.  I came here many times because the value of food is here is awesome. This place is a true fusion between west and east. 1st time we came here, we ordered the dinner special, which is a 3-course meal with a soup, a starter, lamb/chicken as main. I think the price for a set is around $25. It is definitely a good value. For the main course, you could choose between rice and pasta. Both of us are so full afterward. 2nd time we came here, we ordered the afternoon special. I think it is under $10, you could order a dish + a drink. I ordered beef pasta. I highly recommend this place if you want to try great fusion food.",2
"I was so worried this restaurant would be packed when I walked in on Saturday afternoon with a party of 8.  Thank god it was only half full.  The restaurant is on a 2nd level and somewhat small but not too crowded.   The menu is extensive and you can get pretty much everything that's available in Markham.  I got: 1. Grilled chicken with spaghetti in black peppercorn sauce - This was delicious.  The pasta was soft without being soggy and I think they melted a little of butter into it - yum.   - The chicken was a good size and cooked perfectly.   - The sauce complemented the whole dish, I would definitely reorder. 2. The beef skewers were great. But for $8 it was hefty for 4 skewers. We also found a small fly in our fruit salad. The waiter took off my lemonade ice tea to placate us and gave us another small bowl of fruit salad.   3. Chicken fried rice. I shuddered a little when my boyfriend ordered this but it turned out very well overall.  The rice wasn't soaked in soy sauce and tasted like your usual chow fan with nice big chunks of chicken and eggs.  Overall this is a pretty good place to hit up if you're craving HK style food.  Service is Chinese (ie. not friendly but very efficient). Tip: Waiter here speaks both Cantonese and English fluently (huge plus for anybody that's afraid of a language barrier).",2
"This place is good! The food is delicious(curry and other meals), and the waiter is friendly. Nice and cozy environment makes it a better place to hang out with friends here. Will come next time.",2
"It's one of the few Hong Kong cafes (Cha chaan teng) in Chinatown that i'm aware of. It's hidden on the second floor and easy to miss. However, when found, it's a good option for Hong Kong-style Western cuisine in Chinatown.  I really liked their Baked Pork Chop Rice. It was tasty and tangy with generous portions. I would return just for this dish. My mom had the shrimp salad which was generously topped with fruit and shrimp. The Russian Borscht soup was also solid.  Service was friendly and the food came out quickly. Pricing is also pretty affordable. The ambiance is a bit cramped and noisy, but that's to be expected in Chinatown.   The one thing I found off-putting was the presence of dirty glassware on cashier counter-top. It's almost as if they didn't have any other space for it, as there were 10 or so dirty glasses in plain site.  Other than that, I had a positive experience and will be returning in the future.",2
"Hong Kong Bistro Cafe is a HK cafe (cha chaan teng) located in downtown Chinatown. Living in Scarborough, there are tons of HK cafe options in Upper Scarborough and Markham but surprisingly not many downtown that I'm aware of.  HK cafes (cha chaan tengs) serve low cost Canto-Western cuisine and this is a result of Britain's colonization of Hong Kong and as a result it ended up impacting the food served.  I have been to a Hong Kong Bistro Cafe a few times and dropped by recently on a late Friday afternoon during the holiday season. I ordered the lunch special which was a baked grouper in a tomato sauce over a bed of spaghetti, it also came with a soup (choice of Chinese soup, cream soup and Russian Borscht which is essentially a tomato soup) and a HK milk tea for $8.50 plus tax. The spaghetti was pretty basic but the baked grouper was cooked perfectly, really well done. The Russian borscht (tomato soup) soup was basic and the HK milk tea was above average.  Hong Kong Bistro Cafe is a pretty good option downtown if you are looking for a HK cafe and really reasonably priced and service is pretty fast. The food won't blow you away but it's pretty good and the portions are pretty big and fulfilling especially for the price point.",1
"Richmond Hill is full of these types of places (asian style white food...sorry if this was not PC) that are so great, but Toronto seemed to be falling short. However, this place fills that niche, with only the slight price difference being apparently different.   I ordered the chicken friend steak with an escargot appetizer and a cold lemon tea (with an additional dollar for a cold drink). My friend got the steak (which was actually cooked medium rare, with the fruit salad in mayo sauce appetizer, and a hot lemon tea. The appetizer were good, and came quickly. The entrees were huge, and tasted delicious with the classic Chinese black pepper gravy. The tea is not what you come here for, but it wasn't bad, just not noteworthy in terms of Chinese tea. Both of our meals also came with a soup option that was the classic Chinese borscht - that is more tomato soup than borscht.   Service is pretty average, but food is fast, so I was happy! This is kind of what I expect from most Chinese restaurants. I will definitely be back to try their other specials!!!!",2
"The first thing we noticed upon stepping foot into this restaurant was the clean looking, upscale decor. A very pleasant surprise for a Chinese restaurant in the middle of Chinatown!  We ordered the baked pork chop with rice and baked beef brisket with rice. They first served us our complimentary soup, which was one of three of their daily soups. We chose the chinese and tomato soups.  The soups came out immediately, which gave us something to sip on while waiting for the main dishes. The chinese soup was light and pleasant, and the tomato soup was rich and flavourful.  The main dishes came about ten minutes later. Even though it was my first time trying the much hyped tomato pork chop, I knew immediately that it was definitely worth the hype! The pork chops were crispy coming straight out of the oven, and the tomato sauce was the best tasting thing I've ever had in Chinatown. It was just so rich, juicy, creamy, and delicious overall. The beef brisket was also great. The amount of brisket was a very generous portion, and the brisket itself was very tender and soft.  I'd definitely recommend Hong Kong Bistro Cafe for their HK style baked dishes. They're quite different from other types of Chinese cuisine, and definitely worth a try!",2
"Very authentic hong kong bistro, always a big selection of food and the portion sizes are great.  Highly recommend the baked porkchop rice!  They also have a wide selection of soups that are very decent.",2
"A solid china town find. The food is plentiful, delicious and worth it. I love eating their specials because they have great appetizers, soups, teas and set menus. It's pretty cheap for how much you get. I can't describe what Hong Kong style food It's a mix of British influenced Asian food. I always go for spaghetti!",2
We decided to check out Chinatown on our first night in Toronto.  We were in search of something authentic that we couldn't find where we live.  There were so many choices that we were having trouble deciding so we did a Yelp search and took a quick look at the reviews.  That led us to this place.    The restaurant is on the second floor so you will need to look for the stairs beside the sign.  The specials were written on the white boards on the wall.  The regular menu has a ton of choices and some of them I had to look up on the internet.  Our server was very friendly and helpful with questions we had the entrees.    I ordered the Fried Ho Fun with Beef and Black Bean Sauce.  I've never had a black bean sauce that I didn't like so I knew I would probably like this dish.  I didn't know what Ho Fun was but our server described it as a soft noodle so I decided to step outside my comfort zone and give it a try.  Our server brought a cup of the soup special while our food was being prepared.  I chose a creamy soup with chicken.  It was delicious.  The Ho Fun noodles were very good and the black bean sauce was excellent.  There was too much food for me to finish but I made sure to eat all the beef.    This was a very enjoyable new food adventure for us.,2
"Came here for the grilled chicken steak with pepper corn sauce and it didn't disappoint! The chicken was moist and crispy. The sauce didn't overpower the dish but complimented the chicken. Entree also came with a soup - you have a choice of Chinese seaweed, corn or Russian borscht - I choose the Russian borscht. It had a pleasant tomato flavour with pieces of veggies swimming about. Prices are excellent considering the portions. As for the service, the staff were very friendly and accommodating; Attentive but not bothersome. Overall I highly recommended coming here if your looking for HK style diner food. On my momma, you'll love it.",2
"I'm a visual person, and I got to say the pictures here did not look particularly drool-worthy. Alas, do not judge a restaurant by its pictures!  We were super hungry and ordered the Hainanese Chicken Rice, Baked Pork Chop with Spaghetti and Fried Chicken Wings with Chilli Pepper Salt. We also received complimentary soup with our order.  As someone who lived in Singapore for 12 years, the authenticity of the Hainanese Chicken Rice was lacking. The meat was too tough and had a stronger ginger flavour than the usual Hainanese Chicken I was used to. The soy sauce was also missing - a big no-no. The rice, although flavoured, was quite dry. Overall, I would pass this dish and head over to Jackpot Chicken Rice instead.  The redeeming dishes of this cafe were definitely the Pork Chop and Chicken Wings. While the spaghetti was completely different from regular Western pasta (its slightly sweeter and lighter), it complemented the pork chop superbly. The chicken wings, tossed in a chilli and pepper stir fry, is fragrant, savoury, and had a nice crunch. My boyfriend says it may be the best chicken wings he has had!  Definitely don't overlook this cafe!",2
"This place is awesome. The food is cheap, the food is good, the food is unique. Chinese style spaghetti? Yes please.  It's a bit hidden, you have to go up some narrow stairs to reach the restaurant. The decor is pretty plain but it's not disgusting inside like some other hole-in-the-walls.  I always get the baked spaghetti with seafood in white sauce here. The flavours are so good, the calamari in it is so crispy even when doused in the sauce. Come here with a few friends and try a bit of everything if you can. Or just come back as often as you can!",2
"Revisiting Hong Kong Bistro Cafe after their renovation, it was like a totally new experience. The place looks much more modern and inviting. As always, super friendly service and solid food.   I got the grilled chicken steak with black pepper sauce on rice - it was absolutely delicious and it's become my favourite dish there! There was plenty of sauce covering the chicken, which was perfectly cooked as it was tender yet had nice crispy edges. For $11, you get a giant portion and I could only finish about half of it.   The baked pork chop on rice with tomato sauce comes in a large dish but it does take some time to cook. It was very good - the crispy pork chop pieces were tasty and they certain don't skimp on the meat portion compared to the rice.   Lastly, I never pass up the opportunity to get their HK-style milk tea. It's a nice balance of the slight bitterness of the tea and creaminess of the milk.   Overall, Hong Kong Bistro Cafe may not have a flashy menu or ""Instagrammable"" food presentation, but it's delicious food at an excellent price with on point service.",2
"If you don't know about this place or wasn't intentionally looking for it, then you've probably walked past it without noticing. Sandwiched between other Chinese restaurants, you have to walk up a set of stairs to get to the actual restaurant. The decor is straight out of the 70s and to be honest looks a little dingy.   However, appearances aside, this place serves up some authentic HK cafe (Cha Chaan Tang) food. The menu is extensive and eclectic, with a huge selection of fusion items, anything from Portuguese seafood rice to sandwiches. Service was a bit slow, it took almost an hour for us to receive our food from the time we ordered. I believe all entrees come with soup, which helped ride us over.   Despite the lack of signage outside the restaurant, the place was surprisingly busy.   Whether you're missing the food from HK or just want to try something different, give this literal hidden gem a shot.",2
"If you find yourself in downtown Toronto looking for asian food, head to Lee Chen Asian Bistro.  The place is downstairs from the sidewalk and is huge inside...I mean huge.  I suspect they do a great lunch business, but we came after a hockey game on our way back to the hotel.   The service was prompt and always available if you need anything.  The bar/beer scene doesn't offer a lot, but there are a few options to pick from if your in need.   The spring rolls and chicken dumplings were really, really good.  I had sweet and sour chicken which is some of the best I have ever had anywhere.    I definitely would go back and probably spend more time ordering a lot of dim sum as there is a lot to pick from if that is your jam.  They have a huge menu and one trip is not going to satisfy your palate.",2
"Lee Chen is an upscale chinese restaurant in the core of the downtown area. Unlike the more dingy (or more authentic) restaurants on Spadina, Lee Chen is carefully decorated and has more catered service. It is the kind of place you bring your in-laws for family dinners and not your friends after a night out. It is deceptively large since it spans the full basement level of the building, so it is easy to find seating.  Expect to find the usual Americanized Chinese dishes here, with flavors that are catered to the general population. Don't expect to find the more 'exotic' dishes or the sharp flavors that Chinese cuisine has to offer.",1
"Came here for team lunch for CNY. Oh man. This place is packed! When we got to the reception desk, the group in front of us did not have a reservation. They were turned away. Glad we did book the day before.   Anyhow, Chinese food option in the financial district can be rare. And when my colleagues proposed  this place. I was thinking, let's give this a try.   We got here and were led to our table. After we sat down, I saw the other tables were filled up in 15 mins. Talk about busy. One good thing is they got a lot of staff roaming around to deliver food. Yet, they were super busy regardless.   We ordered our food and I went with the business lunch with meatball. The food did come out shortly after. The sauce for the meatball isn't super salty. Which I prefer. It has the right texture for the meatball. Other stuff tasted okay. It ain't bad overall, I wasn't wowed by the food.",1
"First glance of the clientele was a solid sign it would be authentic stuff.  The food was very good! I didn't think it was that ""pricey"" till you think about how inexpensive authentic Dim sum food can generally be. And the bill wasn't what many other reviewers are probably used to. I think still worth it for the most part.   The crystal pork belly was great. The thick noodles in the fried Shanghai noodles where delicious and greasy. The soup dumplings were good, but I think these miss the value to price point the most.   I would definitely come back. Just be aware it is business district prices.",2
"My friends and I love Lee Chen, we come here occasionally to get some Chinese food. The food is not bad, and it's pretty filling. We usually go to their young location but stumble upon this location last time. Comparing to their other location, this one is definitely nicer and bigger.  The only thing is that food is quite expensive here, other than that I don't mind making the trip here once in awhile.",2
"Overall a good experience at Lee Chen. We were heading to the theatre and decided to drop by for dinner. There was still lots of tables available at 6pm on a Wednesday.   We went for the Shanghai Noodles, pork dumplings, chicken fried rice and Wuxi spare ribs. Everything was tasty and exactly what we expected. A lot of times, the food would not come out as pictured, but this was not the case.   Overall a solid Asian restaurant considering it is located in an area that isn't known for the Asian food. Service was swift and the restaurant was roomy. Felt like we were eating in Markham vs. Downtown Toronto.",2
"Excellent food and good service.  The soup dumplings were worth all the hype.  There is a technique to eating them, so don't be shy to ask the waiter to show  you how --fantastically delicious.  The ginger shrimp and pepper beef were equally delicious.  Fried rice was surprisingly greasy and dishes do NOT come with any white rice, you must order (that is why only four stars).  Otherwise, this is a great place to eat, with nice ambience.",2
"The interior here is spacious and clean, which makes it a good place for happy hour or business meals. The servers were quick, but it took some effort to get their attention sometimes.   We had the dan dan noodles, pork belly over rice, XLB, and pan fried dumplings. Although this was a mix of appetizers and dimsum, the amount of food was just enough for us. My favorite was the dan dan noodles, especially with the hot chili oil for those that like spice.   Overall I had a good dining experience but was a bit disappointed with the dimsum selection. I was looking for a good dimsum restaurant in Chinatown and, for being labeled a dimsum restaurant, there wasn't that much.",1
"Lee Chen Asian Bistro is a decent spot for Chinese food near the theatres and financial district. It may look small from the outside, but it's quite large and spacious in the inside. The interior is very clean with nice decor. It even has a small garden and mini running waterfall just outside of the restaurant (great if you can score a table by the window, facing the mini garden). The customer service is very attentive and superior for a Chinese restaurant (e.g. the servers come by your desk to ask if everything is ok a few times throughout the meal, which usually doesn't happen in most other Chinese restaurants).  The menu contains some typical Chinese dishes. During weekday lunch hours, they have a separate lunch ""combo"" specials which are pretty good. Each combo comes with a choice of carbs (white rice, brown rice, fried rice, or fried noodles), meal entrée (protein / veg choices), bowl of side salad, and a spring roll. I ordered the brown rice and it came in a cute bamboo container. The entrée was nicely presented on an edible open flower-shaped bowl made out of crispy wonton skin.  The restaurant is a great choice for having a business or team lunch. The large space can accommodate large parties if booked in advance. The ambience is also nice and not too loud.",2
I was in Canada for TIFF for near all the theaters so I was happy to find this place nearby. I was SO excited to try to the soup dumplings and they did not disappoint! They were small but generally filled well with soup! The dumpling itself was so delicious! I also tried a noodle dish which was very under flavored but the noodles were cooked perfectly. Definitely go for the soup dumplings! You don't be disappointed!,2
"I've never had authentic Chinese food before, so not sure what to compare it to. But the food I had here was simple and flavorful. I had the Shanghai noodles, bok choy with garlic and veggie dumplings. This was a lot of food for two people but we finished it. Everything tasted very fresh and light. Service was a little slow even though the restaurant was empty.",2
"Thought this place would live to the rating but it fell flat, and flavorless. We ordered our food and it literally came in 2 minutes. (Yikes!)  Everything was bland and lacking sauce. Service was nice and welcoming, but the food was just subpar and overpriced. I'd save your money.",0
"I suppose that the price is expected since it is located on King St. W near all these theatres in the heart of the financial district, but it was still quite pricy for the amount of food that they give.  The size of an order of white rice alone was a third of the typical full round bowl of rice in most other Chinese restaurants yet here it costs $2 simply because how it's presented in small wooden steam baskets.  If you are going for a play nearby like my beau and I were or a financier working nearby or maybe going on a downtown date, then this would be the ideal Asian fusion cuisine you will go to. It is classy enough without being downright expensive.  Location: 4/5  It is right next to the Royal Alexandria Theatre or across from the Roy Thompson Hall, a bit west of St. Andrew's Station. So many things nearby to do and see before or after having a meal here.  Decor/Ambience: 4/5  It is located in the basement and parts of the restaurant is dim, but there are small lights here and there on both the ceiling and on the sides of the wall. They have two huge round tables at the back that when not reserved by a large group of people, singles or pairs of individuals would be sitting around the table during busy hours. Otherwise, they have tables for twos and fours scattered throughout the restaurant and a lovely little enclosed area that can be reserved. Red flowers and red lanterns decorated the space and gave it warmth. Since it's neither too dark or too bright inside, each table felt secluded enough for conversations to mingle and intertwine of the buzzling backdrop.  Food quality: 4.5/5  My Thai green curry shrimp with spaghetti was superb! The flavours were incredibly full bodied. Plenty of veggies especially peppers and red onions and the curry was just amazing! The spaghetti was not enough alone to soak in all of that rich flavour or oozing liquid, so I had to order a 'bowl' of white rice. They gave 7 tiger shrimps that tasted great alone or dipped with the curry.  My beau ordered Szechuan style shrimps and scallops and his was spicier than mine and even bolder in flavours.   Both styles of shrimps had us smacking our lips and licking the sauce from our fingers. The scallops were sizeable and I definitely enjoyed the meaty texture.  The quality of food is totally there, so I will definitely come back when I am nearby again.  Their menu is quite extensive actually, so I am sure there will be plenty of other food options that I can order for my next meal here before a musical or the likes.  Service: 3.5/5  Pretty standard, but they refilled our water without having to be asked and they served our dishes rather quickly, so we were in and out within 40 minutes, including the time waiting to be seated and getting the bill. Not bad.   I think most items are meant to be shared, but we are used to having individual dishes each.   Value: 4/5  Expected price due to the location. Food quality is above average but not the best. I would not say that it tasted all that authentic, but that is again to be expected of Asian fusion restaurant. It certainty has a nice mix of flavours and food options, so my beau and I can certainly see ourselves coming back. Hopefully, we will order something more satisfying though next time that includes rice or more spaghetti, cause $2 for that small amount of rice as photoed made me raise my eyebrows.",2
"The service was fast, staff was friendly. Their soup wanton was so good I had to get two orders! The soup within the steamed dumpling was complimented beautifully with their pickled ginger & red vinegar! The pork belly bao was interesting since you can construct it yourself, and the flavour of the marinated pork was mouthwatering. However, the menu is very long and the main dishes   are an afterthought compared to their dim sum.",2
"It's definitely a hidden gem! You have to go down some stairs off of the main street and it'll be on your right! It was the first spot we hit after touching down in Toronto because of the amazing reputation it has. That salt and pepper chicke was OUT OF THIS WORLD! 2 simple seasonings yet so full of flavor. The chow mein was perfect in every way and kung pao beef was juicy, spicy, and perfectly tender! Can't wait to go back",2
"My friend and I were in the area, craving Chinese food, and didn't want to walk too far, so we came here for dinner on a Saturday night. The restaurant is nice on the inside and well kept. The waitstaff are friendly enough and pretty attentive. The food is pretty overpriced though and lacks flavor.  My friend ordered the green onion pancake and wonton soup. I had the spicy beef noodle soup. The green onion pancake was average, but the wonton soup broth had pretty good flavor. There were only three small wontons though, which my friend wasn't happy about. I wish the beef noodle soup had some flavor - it tasted like spicy and mildly salty water, which was surprising given how rich the soup looked. The noodles had a nice springy-ness to them, and there was A LOT of beef. I usually complain there isn't enough beef in my noodle soups, but I couldn't finish all the beef in my soup this time!  I'd consider taking friends here if they've only grown up on burgers their whole life and want to try Asian cuisine (maybe bring some spice packets along...), but I would not recommend this place to people who want authentic Chinese food. Take a 25 minute walk to Spadina Avenue instead.",1
Most amazing dumpling I've had in a while!!! I ordered two different kinds and was so pleased and wish I could have had more but I was so full. I'm from upstate New York and I can't wait to come back to Toronto and come again. Along with great food the service was amazing and the bubble tea was so good as well!!! Definitely stop by if you are in the area,2
"Wonderful Chinese restaurant serving Shanghai Cuisine! I thought this would be a tiny place with mediocre food, but it exceed expectations. The food was authentic and plentiful with great prices. From the moment I walked in, I was wowed by how beautifully decorated, clean and expansive the dining room was.  Service was very pleasant and quick. We came in half an hour before closing. I thought we would be turned away, but the staff was very polite about letting us know that they were closing soon but that they could still serve us. We were gently reminded about getting our order in, last call, and closing our bill without feeling rushed.  The food exceeded my expectations. We got xiaolongbao soup dumplings, pickled greens noodle soup, green onion pancake, and fried potstickers. Everything was delicious and very well priced. The portion sizes were generally good. The noodle soup was massive and a great size for sharing. The only size that seemed a little less than normal were the soup dumplings which came with only six, whereas I usually get ten in an order at other restaurants in the U.S.",2
"Service 3/5 Taste 3/5  This overall is only worth visiting for workday lunches.   If one hunts for delicacy, stay away from this chain.",1
"Came here with my family on a Saturday night. I'm surprised how empty this restaurant is, given that it's downtown at a weekend dinner time.   We ordered soup dumplings (great), braised eggplant (great, although a bit too saucy), braised tofu (the tofu didn't really have much flavour), and a shrimp lettuce wrap (great healthy option, although I didn't care for the regular hoisin sauce that came with it), with a small side of steamed rice.   Great service and very speedy!",2
"Lovely dumpling restaurant!  The prices here are absolutely fantastic and cheap, and the dumplings are delicious. It's quite a hole-in-the-wall type of restaurant. It's very crowded all the time and feels sort of steamy inside during the summer hours--but what would you expect with steaming baskets and so many people?  The steamed dumplings are wonderfully juicy while the pan fried dumplings are crunchy--albeit a bit dry. I recommend trying the soups here! Hot and sour soup is a personal favourite of mine, in general, and this place make it really well!   I'll definitely be coming back again--but probably in the winter time.",2
"With lots of businesses closing at 6pm, I'm grateful dumpling house is open late, until 10:30pm on a week night!  Since the lockdown, I've ordered their vegetarian frozen dumpling, filled with greens and diced tofu, their frozen green onion pancake and their takeout braised eggplant and sautéed green beans.  As a disclaimer, eggplants are probably my favourite things to eat, and i love how buttery it is here at Dumpling House. Just yummy! As for the sautéed green beans, FYI they are seasoned with lots of minced garlic and a spicy and tangy bean sauce. Proceed with caution if you can't take too much heat! Otherwise, to me its just mildly spicy.   Love having this in the neighbourhood, a great spot that I'll definitely visit, hope to dine in soon!",1
"This place has great dumplings (especially their pan fried ones, pork and chive is my fave), but there was one time when I went, maybe almost 2 years ago that really pissed me off. I would be more inclined to give this place 4 stars if it weren't for poor customer treatment.   It was busy in the restaurant and a line was forming. My friend and I had just finished our meal. I had ordered a soy milk and was finishing it while also trying to buy tickets for a movie on my phone. I was aware that there was a lineup and I was trying to hurry but not chug my drink, but I was still finishing so I didn't think it would be an issue. One of the older ladies who runs the restaurant (in Chinese we would call her the 'lao ban niang') complained loudly and angrily to her staff in Chinese that I was playing on my phone and ordered them to clean our table up in an effort to get us to leave. It doesn't sound too bad when I type it out but it's just different in Chinese and her tone was angry. Only my mom talks to me like that when she's scolding me. I was very annoyed when I heard this, but finished my drink and got up to leave. The same woman put on a fake smile and said ""thank you!"" as we walked out the door.   In this case, she probably didn't think I would understand her, which is probably also why she said what she said, but it really ruined my meal. Unfortunately for her, I understood every word. I hope they will exercise more caution when talking about customers in Chinese. I am Asian so I am used to less than ideal service at some mom and pop restaurants so I am understanding of most service at Chinese restaurants but I also don't like being scolded behind my back, and then treated so drastically different to my face.  In that moment I dramatically vowed never to return but the dumplings are too good and I have since returned and had pleasant experiences.  I mean, I doubt the woman even remembers that this happened but it was a bad enough experience that I felt compelled to write about it so long after, but the food is still good and I would recommend this place to people who don't mind feeling rushed when they eat.   I like the potato threads and shanghai noodles in addition to boiled and pan fried dumplings.",1
"TERRIBLE AND EXTREMELY RUDE SERVICE! LEFT DISAPPOINTED WITH THE QUALITY OF FOOD. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO GO.  My parents and I came here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. We ordered Singaporean fried rice noodle and the 15 steamed chives, egg, and dry salty fish dumplings for $10.99.  1. Noodles came out first (really small portions) and then they gave us the bill. We were like what??? Where is our second dish? And they were confused. They then realized they forgot our dumplings.  2. Dumplings came and only 14 out of 15 showed up. We let it slide.   3. Zero eggs and salty fish in the dumplings. ONLY CHIVES   4. When my parents paid the bill, the waitress got angry at us and asked why we didn't tip ... but we did tip and it was underneath the bills. So we were like ""excuse me??? Did you even look to see?"" She flips it over and sees the tip and then changes her energy completely and starts saying thank you. This woman had the audacity to get angry at customers who she treated so poorly yet actually still tipped. Im actually speechless.  Additionally, if you're asian and you complain about the food they just get pissed right back at you. And they tell you your opinion doesn't matter cause the Caucasian people don't seem to mind. Terrible",0
"Food is good, we were craving dumplings and we came to the right place. Got a variety of steamed & pan fried dumplings. Food comes pretty quickly but I wished the place was a bit cleaner. The plastic soup spoon was stained from overuse, the condiments were obviously neve really cleaned well everyday. The worst of it though was when we went to pay the bill the lady demanded we add +$2 for tip. I have never been to a restaurant that has said that to me.",1
"Visited on a quiet Monday evening, service was incredibly fast and our server was very friendly. This place does not take credit/debit! Cash only! We ordered the pork and chives pan fried  dumplings and they were pretty good! Nothing special, just your average pan fried dumpling. Fair price - $10 for 12.",2
"If you're ever in a mood for dumplings and hot and sour soup, take a stroll down Chinatown and make your way to this hole in the wall restaurant and prepare for some delicious dumplings and more!  We started off with the hot and sour soup and a spicy potato dish to entice our appetite and clear my sinuses since I was a little sick. The hot and sour soup was one of the better soups I've had over the years and the spicy potato dish wasn't too spicy but an appetizer to share amongst the table. After a little wait the two dishes of pan friend dumplings came and let me tell you, I've never been this excited to see dumplings until now. They were crunchy, juicy from the pork inside and coated with a little bit of oil on the outside which added a nice flavour coating to the dumplings.  All in all I would definitely come here again on a rainy day and suggest this restaurant to all of my friends! 5/5 stars for the food and the staff were very nice to me and my girlfriend as well. No issues anywhere!",2
"Service was as ok, dumplings are ok (depends) place is kinda gross.   If you're not picky then this place might have good dumplings for you, just ignore the poor cleanliness of the place then you're good! The plates they use look old, and I question the cleanliness of the stuff they use. I saw a pile of serving plates near the front where they're cooking and I couldn't figure out if it was the dirty pile or the clean pile.  Service is prompt, I've been here a couple of times. My first time was with my s.o., who is white. We pretty much got ignored most of the time, the only time they attended to us was to ask for our order and to pay.   The second time was with my Chinese friend, she spoke in Mandarin to them and I noticed they actually filled up my water a couple of times, I have no idea if it's cause I went with her.  Now for the dumplings, my friend said that the wrapper they used was too thick for her liking, and she said it made sense since they used dough. I didn't mind but the filling of the dumpling had a gross bitterness to it, and this comes from someone that willingly eats bitter melon. The pan fried one tasted better, but near the end we got sick from eating it cause of the oil, it pooled at the bottom.  The first time I went here, I only got steamed dumplings, I got the mushroom and spinach one and it was tasty. My boyfriend got steamed pork dumplings and he didn't complain, although he seldom does. I definitely think it's a must try but you can only pay in cash so make sure you bring some. If you're with TD, you might need to trek a bit if you want an ATM, otherwise CIBC, RBC and Scotiabank clients are good since the ATMs are in close proximity",1
"CASH only. There's a bunch of banks/ATMS around the area so you're good just in case. Service is less to be desired but the dumplings were pretty solid. If it's your first time, I recommend trying 3 different flavours first for $12-13 (additional $2) instead of committing 12 dumplings to one flavour. They've got steamed and pan-fried. We really like the pork and shrimp - the only juicy and flavourful dumpling. The classic pork and chive were quite dry and the spinach needed salt to save its integrity. Tried their beef noodles and was super garlicky and the noodles were broken up which was annoying to eat.  Overall, will I be back, probably not - considering there are so many other dumpling spots in the area that will probably have better dumplings and better service.",1
"You definitely come here for the dumplings and not the service. In typical Chinese fashion, the customer service here is nearly nonexistent. As we walked in, a waitress barked ""cash only"". Half way through our meal we were asked ""any more?"" and before we had a moment to discuss, we were given the bill. Finally, before we actually finished our food, a waitress started clearing our table.   However, with that said, their dumplings are definitely their redeeming quality. They are handmade and fresh, from the wrappers to the fillings. They also offer a good variety; they have chicken, beef, pork, lamb, shrimp, and vegetarian dumplings. It is also a fairly cheap eat and it is easy to share. If you are willing to put up with poor customer service for good food, this is a decent option.",1
"Had a day to spend in Toronto and had heard many good things about Chinatown so off I went.  I was in the mood for dumplings and found the reviews to be good.    Was seated quickly and it was time to eat.  I ordered the pork steamed dumplings and Shanghai noodles and they were good.  I knew that the dumplings were going to be good when I saw them making them in the front window.     This is a cool little restaurant that is a bit of a hole in the wall but has great food.  Service here was good and the food came out in a timely manner.   The noodles came out first and was surprised but then realized they are making the dumplings fresh in the window.  Good flavor in the noodles with lots of meat.   The dumplings came out and I was surprised with the number in the order.     All in all food was good, service was on par and it was a good experience.  One word of warning is that they only take cash.",2
"Life just isn't the same after you have been to dumpling house.  I mean- it wasn't until this very moment that I realized my town has no dumpling game whatsoever.....   So , before going, it is important to note that this is a CASH ONLY establishment so make sure you got some paper on you.    The food here is fantastic.  So - my insights....  I wish I hadn't been so ""safe"" with my ordering.  I wish that instead of ordering the fried dumplings, which were delicious by the way, I wish I had ordered more of the steamed dumplings.  The were Uber authentico and seemed to have their own plump juiciness, with very clearly pronounced flavors.  The little guys were amazing.  My recommendation is to try the pork and chive- very very good!    As far as being a great place for groups or kids, this place is a hole in the wall type of joint- the whole place is close quarters- but worth it.  The very moment you walk in, it is through an open kitchen with ladies at the window hand stuffing dumplings-  it's pretty sweet.",2
"I am not sure why this place doesn't have better reviews, we absolutely loved it. They make it very clear from the beginning it's cash only so be prepared for that. We got the general tao's chicken which was quite good. We also got the steamed pork and chive dumplings and those are what dreams are made of. I was telling my husband we should get them shipped to us in San Diego. Would definitely come back",2
"This was my second time dining at this establishment, but mark my words it is the last! While eating an order of noodles I was splitting with my gf I came across a COCKROACH!!!!!    When I confronted the owner he looked down at my plate and saw the roach and quickly took my plate and dashed to the kitchen before I had a chance to take a photo.  The only funny and bewildering part to this is that a group of people standing behind me waiting to be seated saw what had happened and witnessed the roach in my noodles and still decided to stay and dine !!!!  FAIR WARNING TO ALL, DO NOT EAT HERE!!! COCKROACHES ARE ALSO DINING AMONG YOU!!!",0
"As a self proclaimed dumpling snob where my mom's dumplings are 15/10, this place can settle for an 8/10.   I'm honestly surprised by the less than stellar reviews. Sure, I've been skeptical of this place myself when I pass by it as I walk in Chinatown because I don't trust window displays of women making dumplings from scratch, but upon the chance of eating here, I would recommend you go just go here already.   I ordered the steam dumplings and they tasted made to order! The skin (which I'm most concerned about) was not that thick and the filling was just right. It was a good skin to meat ratio if you know what I'm saying.   I got the chive with pork which I really liked. Any chive dumplings- sign me up! If I'm craving some homemade dumplings, you bet i'll come here again!!",2
"Reliable, quick and tasty. It's not fancy, not much seating, but those line ups should tell you something.   The depth of the menu and simplicity lends itself to repeat visits.",2
"Literally one of my favorite places we ate in Toronto! We stumbled upon this place in Chinatown and were not disappointed!   The restaurant itself is small but they employees work quick to get food out fast! As you walk in, you can see the dumplings being made in the window and fried/steamed right there! The price was reasonable, the portions were huge, and the food was delicious! For two of us we definitely over ordered but could not decide what to eat and just got a bit of everything!  We ordered the fried pork dumplings, chicken fried noodles, and green onion pan cake! My favorite was the dumplings but you are at the House of Dumplings! Everything else was fantastic...we had to stop ourselves from licking the plates clean!  If in the area and visiting Chinatown, definitely check it out!!",2
"Really good food, but woefully underprepared for the dinner time rush. Very small, cramping area. They are trying to get everyone through as fast as possible and want you to order right away which is understandable but they also dont make effective use of their space which hurts them and their staff is kind of running around lost.  The dumplings are, however, 5 star. The food is wonderful, fresh, and made to order. Highly recommended but I would advise going at off hours.",2
"Just wondering, should we measure authenticity in proportion to how the customer is treated? This place must be somewhere in the middle because no one had enough patience for us, but actually when we gave smiles we received a little smile back. I haven't talked yet about authenticity of food. I've been in Asian restaurants in the Toronto area where they treated us like intruders, but not this one. We needed some time to choose our food and we actually took it. Come on! We know time is money, but we really wanted to see what they actually offer.  Our group had five people. They seated us at the table next to the wall and for sure, never again. It just doesn't work. It was too little space for five serving plates with the food we ordered, plus we wanted to share everything and it was just a mess.  It was actually my second visit here and the first time I wished they gave us a table not in the middle of the restaurant but next to the wall. Yeah, I wanted to be romantic. I think it is all about please come, order, eat and go. Faster better.  Anyway... Food was great! We enjoyed every bit of it. We had two kinds of dumplings, fried pork and chive and steamed spinach and black mushrooms. We agreed our steamed choice was poor because it tasted bland and we actually didn't see any mushrooms in it. But you know what to do, dip it into some sauce you created and voila! Delicious! We also ordered Ma-Po's Tofu, Black Bean Beef and pork dish, not sure right now which one it was, but everything was very good. Beef was very tender, tofu in sauce extremely satisfying and pork also was nicely spiced and tasted just right.  Definitely will go back to have more dumplings and some of great looking noodles.",2
"The food was great and reasonably priced, we had the sweet and sour chicken, steamed pork & chive dumplings, and mixed vegetables.  The service was fast and they told us it was cash-only upfront which I liked. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was how tight/cramped the place was. The place was full (about 6:00pm Wednesday). It was difficult to walk through the aisles between the tables, and the tables are tiny so you have to Tetris all your plates to fit properly, but otherwise it was really tasty and I'd for sure go back for the food.",2
"It's a bit of a no-frills place -- definitely not too fancy place by any standards. However, it's a typical Chinese resturant serving an extensive menu with hundreds of items and fairly convienient in its location and hours. It gets kinda loud inside and they only allow debit and credit card over a certain amount but that's okay.   They have a lot of the comfort food staples, like fried rice, congee, or mapo tofu etc. I typically come here for the cold cuts like the roast duck or BBQ pork (char siu). You can get it as a dish on its own or have it over rice.   In general, if you're looking for Chinese take-out or a simple dish over rice, this is the place to be at. They also have more expensive stuff as well, like seafood but I'm not sure how popular it is.  And oh yeah, there's Hong Kong milk tea for like two dollars, which is pretty boss.",2
"Review is for take out. Normally when I order crispy chow mein, other restaurants will separate the sauce and the noodles. Not here, by the time I got home the noodles were all soggy    The shrimp spring roll was such a disappointment with barely any shrimp, only one bite actually had shrimp in there.   I ordered via Ritual so I thought the pick up would be simple. There is absolutely no physical distancing at all, the entrance was tight, people were crammed and confused, overall it was chaotic. Improvement needed.",0
"The menu is extensive and delicious!  So many choices. I had the BBQ pork and duck rice, wonton noodles, fried noodles and fish congee. They're famous for their freshly made noodles in soup or lo mein amongst their rice and congee dishes.  For today's standards, the quantity is fairly sizeable and the price is right. Can't go wrong here. This place opens late, caters to locals and tourists, can speak (broken) English and is considered clean (and new) for old Chinatown. Definitely worth visiting if you're in the area.",2
"A friend of mine invited me to have dinner here as we wanted to experience a night out in Toronto's China town.   We ordered the Hot and Sour soup as the starting dish. The medium size was more than enough to offer two servings to four adult males with big appetites.   Followed by a full order of the roasted duck that came in two varieties, traditional BBQ duck breast and duck chop suey. They even provided thin dumpling wraps that made it easier to eat the duck.   The Chinese Broccoli and Salted Fish Fried Rice were the last two items in our order. The rice dish was perfectly seasoned and the salt did not over power the dish at all.   This restaurant is perfect for a quick meal at a reasonable price right in the heart of Toronto's iconic Chinatown.",2
"Nothing hits better than late night Chinese food. The peking duck here is the best in Toronto! I usually get the peking duck and switch the 2nd course to duck fried rice. The first course comes with thin crepes to roll the duck, with spring onions and cucumber with hoison sauce to dip. This place is always busy, which is a great sign. The duck fried rice is PACKED with the rest of the duck. They are definitely not stingy with the meat and you really do get the rest of the duck in there! Street parking is free after 9 so it makes late night munching convenient. Love this place, highly recommend.",2
Food: 4 Stars Service: 4 Stars Ambience: 3 Stars Fill Factor: Stuffed  I used to pass by this place all the time but rarely ever went in until a few years ago when I dined here with some friends. Since that day I have been coming here way too often and I consider this place to be my go to in Chinatown when I crave Chinese food.  The menu here is huge and it ranges from the BBQ pork/roast duck hanging in the window to fried rice/noodles/congee to seafood and much more. With so many options it is always difficult to make up my mind what to order however I do have some go to dishes when I simply can't make up my mind. My first recommendation is the ginger and onion lobster which is my personal favourite style of lobster. The sauce on this is just delicious and it is always fun getting your hands dirty cracking those shells open. The fried turnip cake is also good here as I like the lightly crisped skin with a hint of spiciness. You also cannot go wrong ordering noodles here but my personal favourite is the ho fun with beef and black bean sauce.  Service here is efficient and casual in a good way. The staff here treat you like a friend speaking informally and occasionally cracking jokes. Everyone is friendly and food gets to your table super fast.  The space itself is fairly spacious with a lot of seating. If you come by yourself or in a pair though they may ask you to share a large table with other strangers (it is optional) so do not be surprised if they ask.  House of Gourmet has become my go to whenever I am in Chinatown and want a casual meal. Note that this place can get loud when it is busy with the chattering of people and dishes clanking so definitely not a good spot if you want a quiet meal. Otherwise it is perfect if you want a lively environment with good food.,2
"If you're out late night and want to grab some Asian food, then this restaurant is the perfect spot as it closes at 4am. We came around 9:30pm and the restaurant was pretty packed. You can't expect over the top service compared to other restaurants, but for a typical chinese restaurant standards, this restaurant is on average with it.   We ordered their bbq pork/roasted pork and the black pepper sauce rice with beef.  - Bbq Pork/ Roasted Pork: As expected, since it was pretty late at night, the meat wasn't fresh. The roasted pork was cold and the skin wasn't as crunchy vs being fresh. The bbq pork was pretty dry and was not juicy at all. - Black Pepper Sauce rice with beef: This dish was actually really good which is why the ratings not as low. Since it was cooked fresh, the beef was tender and juicy, and the sauce tasted great. Portion size was pretty decent but for the price you pay, you only really get 3-4 pieces of beef.   I'll probably skip this place next time if I wanted late night food and try out some other restaurants which were pretty busy as well.",1
"I came to House of Gourmet looking for a quick lunch break from work.   It's been quite a while since I had some noodles in soup so I decided upon going to a place I've known since childhood. Upon entering, I was seated immediately and I ordered a bowl of Beef Brisket Rice Noodle Soup.   The broth was exactly how I remembered from my youth. Layers of flavour, while still retaining its heat. The rice noodles were cooked to a decent al dente, however the beef brisket was a bit disappointing. It was not tender and took quite a while for me to chew. I did wish they cooked down the brisket a lot more as any good beef noodle soup does require soft and tender beef brisket.   The service is what you would expect at any quick service Chinese restaurant. You go there, order quickly, eat and get out.   It's a great place for a quick bite from their wide extensive menu, especially if you're looking for a homestyle meal after the bar/club. This place has lot a bit of its mystique from its hey day but it is still one of Chinatown's prime spots for Cantonese food.",1
"Fairly average Chinese food but open late until 2:00 am with lots of seating. They are located a block or so from from Spadina on Dundas.  Their food seems pretty average to me except for their char siu (BBQ Pork) on rice that is my favorite. Everything else is ok but with the exception of great wok hei. If you're looking for a quick bite after a night out this place will do since they open until 2:00 am and has plenty of seating. Their menu is fairly intense about 500 items and with plenty of seating for a big group.   The food comes out super fast piping hot. Service is ok just need to keep flagging someone down, their table turn over is quick that is the way they operate so don't expect stellar service but they aren't horrible either.",1
"My favourite 'after the club' meal!  I used to go here all last summer that the staff started recognizing me and my friends. This was when they used to have the kitchen open until 4am (2am is when they close it now).  I finally came back here on Saturday and the staff was all still so friendly to me, the food was amazing as it was last summer. There are so many items on their menu, whatever you're crazing you'll find!  The lobster and pork are probably my two favourite things from them!",2
"This place is conveniently located about two blocks from the Dundas St. and Spadina Ave. intersection. This place is big, and it is open til 2 am which is great.  I come here a lot. The selection here is amazing. There are at least 1000 items on the menu. Because there's so many items, some times it's a hit or miss unless you've tried many of them. So, I'll have to subtract a star to account for some of the misses. For instance, their steamed fish was over-cooked. And their congee quality is not consistent. Sometimes it is thicker, and sometimes it is watery  I'll say a bit about the items I love to get here. I love the clams with black bean sauce here. These are very flavourful. The clams are quite meaty, and the  sauce is not too thick or watery. These go great with a bowl of rice. The tofu pot with chicken and salted fish is also a great go to. The  tofu is nice and soft with tons of flavour from the chicken and salted fish. The last thing I love here is the stir-fried pea tips. The pea tips are not old, but are quite crisp with some light crunch. These are absolutely amazing if you have not tried them.  Overall, I'd recommend coming if you are looking for some Hong Kong style Chinese food.",2
"House of Gourmet is a great spot for late night Chinese food with huge portion at reasonable price! However, don't expect anything extraordinary because you get what you pay for.   On all of my visits, even ones at 2AM, the place was constantly busy so service always seemed so rushed. The restaurant offers a several options of typical Chinese dishes such as dumplings, fried noodles/rice, soup, etc. My go-to is definitely seafood congee! It is cooked to just the right consistency, not too watery or too thick. Seafood includes shrimp, fish fillet, abalone, scallop, squid and small pieces of ginger that really brings out the flavor! The portion for a small congee is super filling that will likely keep you full until the next meal. I've also tried their noodles soup with BBQ duck & BBQ a few times but it was meh. One time I'd find the broth to be too bland, and other times it was so salty. Other than that, the noodles also comes with generous amount at decent price.  Overall, House of Gourmet is definitely a good choice for late night food, but the quality doesn't really stand out from other restaurants.",1
"Good for assisting in the time of need.....HANGOVERS.  These guys are open and you can order before 4pm unlike some nasty places who don't care about my suffering.  The food is very reasonably priced and pretty good too, a usual is the beef in black bean sauce which is solid and very filling...on the other hand the fried rice dishes are not the greatest and can lack a lot of flavor.  Good place just be sure what your ordering is something powerful in flavor as the more subtle options generally tend to fail.",1
"Spontaneous craving for Chinese food but wanting to give other restaurants a chance in Chinatown led me to House of Gourmet.   Portions are on the smaller side and they were decent enough to satisfy cravings. Wasn't much of a wow factor in my opinion. Ordered Yeung Chow fried rice, sweet and sour pork, beef soya sauce noodles, turnip cakes and snow peas for a group of 4. Topped it off with a iced lemon tea each.",1
(SKIPTHEDISHES Delivery Review)  My friend and I decided to order delivery on a Saturday morning.  They have a HUGE menu and it was actually a little confusing for indecisive me to find something I could decide on.  We ended up getting: 1. Pork & Preserved Egg Congee: My friend really enjoyed this 2. Minced Beef Congee: The congee came to my apartment HOT (yay) and it was really well made in my opinion. There was a good amount of beef and I liked the amount of ginger in there to give it extra flavor (and it makes me feel 'healthier' 3. Dough Sticks: These were still warm when it arrived. Fairly standard but still a positive that it made it to the apartment without being soggy 4. Rice rolls with Shrimp & Soy Sauce: Never ordering these again. The shrimp didn't seem like it was fresh. The rice rolls were really chewy and plasticky instead of being soft and silky. For $7 the portions were TINY.   For those 4 very basic things it came to about $27 (not including delivery charge).  I used to come here when I was really little with my grandma as her temple is right next door. I'd come back just to see how it compares in person.,1
Food was excellent. Very delicious. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. The lobster was amazing. Very tender. Friendly and polite customer service.,2
"This is my first and last time trying this place, here is why: 1. Service: I get it, lots of people come here for food, lineup is long, and not that many waiters, but when I was trying to order food, the server was literally so impatient that he kept tapping his fingers on the table loudly, I spent like 2 minutes thinking and he made me feel like I was wasting his time. This is a big NONO for me. 2. The rice noodle roll around fried dough炸两肠粉: for all the people on yelp who recommended it, I really think u should try more places for this before recommendation. I have never seen people put it in soy sauce, ITS SUPPOSED TO BE CRISPY and u put it in liquid, what is the common sense here? And the bottom layer of it was so soggy I didn't even know what I was eatin, mush or food. Then I took a bite of the top layer rolls which did not touch any of the sauce, the fried dough was so soggy and soft and then I suddenly understood why they had to put sauce on it ---- to cover the fact that they don't even know how to make this dish. DO NOT ORDER. 3. Two meat combo rice - roasted pork and roasted duck. When we asked them about the roasted pork, waiter said ""it's crispy"", it WAS 100% NOT CRISPY. I don't understand how do they expect people to pay for dishes with this low quality, I really don't get it.  I can find at least 3 restaurants which costs much less in Chinatown and still beats this place in every aspects, so if I were u, I would avoid it for life.",0
This is my go-to place for Chinese food when I am in Chinatown as the menu is expansive and price is really reasonable for the quantity of food. On weekend nights the place is usually packed with a small wait to get seated if you come in a large group.  I tried their afternoon lunch specials for the first time - Yeung Chow Fried rice and stir fried vermicelli. Portion sizes were great for $5.60 and comes with a coffee or milk tea. The restaurant was fairly busy to my surprise at 4pm which was neither lunch nor dinner hours.   Overall I would definitely be back again as I like their wide menu selection and even picky eaters would find something they enjoy eating here!,2
"My family was enticed with the lobster special while we were walking outside Chinatown. The server was very helpful to us when choosing our selection from the HUGE menu. The steamed fish was a great choice & so soft it falls right off the bones. I would've liked the fried squid to be crisper but it was alright. Dry spicy lobster with ground pork was also great. Not a bad stop at all. Not sure what the norm is here but white rice is an extra $1.50 for a VERY small bowl, so be prepared to spend a few more bucks if you want rice with your dish.",2
"Terrible service. Despite seeing my party, they continued to ignore us until we stopped them while they were walking by us. Food was cold and did not taste good at all. Highly do not recommend.",0
It tastes different. I probably should list it as one my my favs.,2
"Oh my God!! How did they get high ratings!!????? They had sectional sittings and some open areas. The place is dark for a Chinese restaurant. The decor is mostly wooden plaques and wood carvings.   The servers or staff there were not friendly and talked behind your back. Yes, I understand Mandarin even though I spoke English to them!! I had to get up twice to get their attention and they only had three tables with customers.   It's supposed to be fine dining so I had a feeling that the portion would be smaller. Ok. But why all the saltiness in your dishes!!! The veggie dish was pricey and decent. The shrimp fried rice lacked the shrimps. They were tiny!! The rice was hard. It felt more of a Caucasian dish. The beef and broccoli dish was the largest dish full of salt!! Basically eat and drink lots of water.   I was obviously not satisfied or full. Dishes were TOO SALTY, even my friend didn't like them.   Never will I go back!",0
"Feast for two: came here for a casual meal and was so pleasantly surprised! Loved the authentic Chinese food here, and props on the portions. The atmosphere here is also good, setting is great for both friends gathering or family outing.  I strongly recommend getting the shredded Chinese cabbage with pork belly - it's spicy and savory, really hit the spot for me.  Also recommend the pickled Chinese cabbage with boiled pork soup. There's tofu inside, and warms you up as well as working up your appetite.  The shredded pork with garlic sauce and the spicy chicken with potatoes were quite good as well, tastes just like your typical authentic Chinese food.",2
"Great little upscale spot. We ordered the shrimp pan friend dumplings which were bright and flavorful.  We also ordered the Kung Pao Chicken which was freaking fantastic!  It was more than enough food for two people.  Service was decent, prices were fair.  Standard beer selection.",2
"This is my favorite Chinese place for spicy northern food since Anne's Magic Kitchen mysteriously shuttered. I recommend visiting with someone who can read Chinese as the Chinese menu options are more extensive (sorry anglophones, you get a concise and diluted white-adapted menu)  I recommend these dishes: 夫婦肺片（a Szechuan style cold appetizer of sliced lung and tripe with sliced beef, drizzled in chili oil), 口水雞(if you've had drunken chicken, this is like a hot, super spicy and scintillating version of that) , 牛肉手抓餅（an elastic yet flaky Chinese pastry, kind of like paratha is shaped like a tortilla and either rolled up with layers of beef or another meat and served burrito style or sandwich style). Those are some to start with. Of course if you're feeling adventurous you can always just point to the next table who probably would have a hot pan with fish or meats in it, bubbling with chilis, scallions and sesame oil and try a lovely spicy northern Chinese stew.   The first time I came here it was packed with young (and well off) Asians wearing high fashion streetwear and kpop haircuts. We got a table for 2 in 5 minutes and orders seemed to lag a bit and it was hard to flag down the server. But the food is indelibly savoury and makes up for the disorganized service.",2
"This restaurant has a very dedicate environment. The bricks on the wall are very beautiful. The food was delivered literally within 8mins after the order placed. The owner is so friendly and considerable. He stopped us for placing more orders because the portion of the food is so large. Moreover,the price is good. Also, they have free delivery when you order more than$30 before tax. Great option when you considering to throw a party.",2
"Real good food, 10/10 would recommend   All the dishes are in fairly large portion, we order 4 dishes and was enough for a party of 4.  Interior decor was good too",2
"If I was able to give 0 stars, I would. This is probably the worst restaurant I've eaten at.   We ordered 5 dishes, 4 of which were completely inedible. - Traditional pancake: This was our first dish and was fairly tasty. No complaints here. This was the only redeeming part of the experience. - Green beans with minced meat: It was too salty and too oily.  - Kungpow shrimp: This is absurdly greasy and spicy which left our tongues numb.  - Fried rice with pineapple and seafood: In contrast to the previous two dishes that were over-spiced, this was tasteless and (surprise surprise) oily as heck.  - Lobster with ginger and scallion: This was the most pathetic dish of them all. We were served either a baby lobster that had not yet developed any meat, or they somehow threw out half of the lobster before plating it. On top of this, it did not taste fresh.  Sometimes terrible food can be saved by good service. Nope, not today unfortunately. The waiters were amateur (pleasant, and well-meaning but did not know what they were doing). They gave us a dirty fork, and when we alerted them to it, they took it away then brought it back and said ""we washed it for you"".   You might look at my profile picture and judge me for being a clueless white guy. I went with a group of 3 other Chinese people who know food well, and we were all appalled at how this restaurant is even open for business.",0
"Amazing food, really flavourful and especially good if you want some authentic spice. The interior is beautiful and really clean. It's really close to uoft so I come every now and again. Definitely my go to place nowadays.",2
"98 aroma was amazing. We had our buddy Jerry take us. He is from Sichuan province in China. I asked him to show me the most authentic food in Toronto that he has found. He took me here! We got a little bit of everything. We got a tofu dish(better than I expected by far). A spicy beef dish (not too spicy). A cold chicken dish(tasty but the fat coagulates when it's cold and is like eating jelly). And vegetable soup(it had pork and chicken in it so be careful). The taste was 10/10 and so was the service.l, however I didn't do any of the ordering as Jerry ordered everything in mandarin. Very authentic. Very impressed.",2
"Great ambience, great authentic Chinese flavour!if you ever want to try good Chinese food this is the place I would recommend, and more importantly, the flavour has been consistent since it's grand opening, not all Chinese restaurant dt toronto qualifies in terms of that, anyway, good place if u want to try great & authentic Chinese food with reasonable price!",2
We had the sticky pork stir fry with pepper and eggplants. They tasted like authentic Chinese food. There was only a few tables when we went there to eat around 12:30pm on weekday. I feel like the table is a little slick..? And there was a slight smell when you step into this place (this happened somtime,2
"98 Aroma is a great place for authentic Sichuan food in Toronto. We ordered Fish in hot oil, fried potato and eggplant with green pepper, and a marinated beef appetizer. All were amazing! Very fresh, flavorful, and authentic. This is some of the best Chinese food I've had in a while. I highly recommend 98 Aroma.",2
"Really tasty food, nice decor.  We got mo bun, plus summer breeze salad, and original pancake.  Taste is fantastic, service is attentive. Would def come back.",2
"Great authentic Chinese restaurant with a great variety of food, tasty dishes, and good services. In order to truly enjoy the breadth of food selection, you need to ask for the Chinese menu and check out the specials posted on the wall.",2
"Inattentive staff, over cooked food. Noodle break right apart because it's so overdone.",0
"5/5 venue. Super clean (even the washrooms) for a Chinatown establishment and beautiful interior design -- traditional Beijing palace style! Super cool place to take a date or someone not so familiar with the Chinese culture for an ""authentic"" experience.......  But 3/5 food. Why? No major flaws with taste or quality, but unfortunately the dishes are just kind of boring. The regional cuisine served here is northeastern Chinese, which is my specialty since I hail from Shandong, as do the owner and some of the staff! I find the dishes very clean in that I feel that 98 Aroma uses less corn starch, oil, sodium, and possibly MSG than many other Chinatown restaurants.  3/5 value. Portion sizes are reasonable, but don't expect anything huge that would last for a week for under $10 like at House of Gourmet, etc. Pricier than most Chinese restaurants, but 98 Aroma can get away with this since they do have a swankier and more fusion feel. Think R&D, but with more Chinese-influence. A good place to take your Caucasian coworkers or in-laws, but not to dine alone just because.   A few notes about specific dishes-  1. I've had the soups here before and the Hot & Sour soup is actually a huge portion even as a small size. The delicate mushrooms soup is not as substantial, so cannot stand alone as a meal.  2. Do order the Summer Breeze Veggie Salad (vegan) -- and make sure you MIX it well as all the sauce (and flavor) is at the bottom of the bowl. $9.99. Big portion, enough to share between 2 people or have as a lighter meal. I loved the textures and glass noodles.  3. Very mediocre Assorted Delicate Veggies (vegan). Broccoli, celery, carrots, and fried tofu. $14.99. Way too basic.  4. My gfs had the scallion pancakes, which looked more cooked and crispier than the ones my mom makes at home, but gfs enjoyed these.   5. Can't remember the menu name, but gfs ordered a huge ass chicken udon stew, which was massive. They really liked the chicken and flavors here.   6. Fried green beans with minced beef -- beans were oily and gfs weren't a fan. $13.99.  They take credit, debit cards at no extra charge. We didn't make a reservation for 7PM on a Friday night and were seated immediately, so customer volume is definitely not as high as it used to be a year ago.  Overall, would return, but only with Chinese food novices or for a special occasion.",1
"We made the trip to Chinatown specifically to try this place out, as per a friend's recommendation. Walking into this restaurant was literally a breath of fresh air. Maybe b/c it's one of the newer ones, but inside has such a imperial setup.  Mostly spacious with good ventilation and SEATS!! compared to a lot of take-out places in Chinatown. They even had a bar on the inner half of the restaurant with a marbled table that lit up orange O_O; Here are my top 3 favourites (in no particular order):  1. Summer Breeze (Signature Veggie Salad) ~$9.99 -taro crisps, sweet-potato noodles (Woo See in canto), leeks, bell-peppers, red cabbage, radishes, onions, and carrots that are all julienned! it had a delightful sweet-salty vinaigrette dressing. I loved this salad a lot!  2. Steamed Garlic Shrimp ~$18.99 I don't like shrimp, and I don't like chili oil, but this dish made me love both of it. Good quality shrimp with the heads attached (ALWAYS a plus), and the grated garlic was cooked and added this flavour that literally tasted like that delicious purpley shrimp paste in a jar you add to tung choy. Also instagrammable with their presentation  3. Pan Fried Pork Buns (6 pcs) ~$9.99  OH MAN THIS WAS SUPERB! Juicy on the inside and super crispy on the outside. Probably used dark meat on the inside because it had a resilient texture. Didn't even need to dip any sauce.   Also if you like to eat spicy food, try the Steamed Tilapia Fish with Chopped Bell Chili ~$29.99 All my friends loved this dish and even threw in some e-fu noodles b/c the sauce was that good! Apparently it's the restaurant's signature dish too..  The dish was massive and heavy.. it took up most of the table lol!  TL;DR If you like Northern Chinese food, fine-dining, and affordable prices, it's worth the trip :D !!!!!!!",2
"In Chinatown, there is a plethora of Asian dining options to choose from. Recently, I had the opportunity to check out the newly opened 98 Aroma where they offer refined Northern Chinese cuisine. The prices are higher than some of the neighboring establishments, so I highly recommend going with a group of 3-5 people to offset the costs. This way, you can order several dishes to share, as most plates are served with generous portion sizes and are meant for sharing.   The outside may look unassuming, but the interior was designed to replicate traditional Chinese decor with its elaborate wood ornaments, and Asian-inspired craft works. The dimly lit restaurant sets a very relaxing ambiance, and there are several private booths available along with tables.    The menu consisted of several popular Northern Chinese dishes like dumplings, scallion pancakes, and spicy seafood and beef dishes. Most of Northern Chinese dishes are characterized by its bold flavors, and dishes are served in big portions. So, you can expect both at 98 Aroma. My friend and I started off with the refreshing Summer Breeze Salad ($9.99) - a colorful mixture of sweet-potato noodles, julienne leeks, bell-peppers, red cabbage, radishes, onions, and carrots with a sweet vinaigrette.   Northern Chinese cuisine is very wheat-based, so I had to order the Pan Fried Pork and Chives Dumplings ($9.99), which was very good. The crispy potstickers were filled with a generous amount of pork, and the chives gave it a nice aroma after being pan fried.   Next up was their signature dish, the Steamed Tilapia with Chopped Bell Chilies ($29.99) - the dish arrived in a considerable sized bowl with the bone-in tilapia slathered in a rich yet spicy sauce. The fish was juicy and flaky, and the chili-based sauce complemented it beautifully. However, there were just way too many bones, so be extra careful when eating.   I enjoyed the crispy texture of the Fried Salt and Pepper Calamari ($15.99), and it was perfectly spiced.   Out of all the dishes, my least favorite was the Signature Chicken Wings ($15.99). Pricewise, it's pretty expensive for wings, and it was lacking in flavor. The peppers were sporadically spread out to the side, so it wasn't spiced very well.  Overall, I had an enjoyable dining experience at 98 Aroma. The restaurant was bustling with customers that Friday evening, and I thought that the wait staff did a good job of handling the customer service. Since they are a new establishment, there were two new waiters on staff training around that time. They were relatively slow, but it's understandable since they're new. 98 Aroma is a welcome addition to the area as they offer a more refined take on Chinese food, and is sure to please the people in the area looking for a nice place to dine.",2
"Really good food, plus good service. It had become one of my go to places when I'm with friends and have a hard time picking a restaurant.",2
"Taste really good, authentic Chinese food restaurant. Cheap and in a very good value.  Self serve. Good for breakfast.  Sometimes this place is too busy, difficult to find a seat.  Definitely have to try.",2
"We were in town for a bit of loligagging, so for lunch, my friend was interested in hitting up this soup dumpling spot. So we did and we came and we put in an order.  Both the steamed and the fried soup dumplings were really good, specially the crab and pork dumplings. The buns are delicious as well.   Only thing I can ding them for is the temperature. I happen to like my soup dumplings destroy your mouth hot. That's how it served traditionally, this is how it should be served here.   I enjoyed our little smash down here. Would totally come back and smash here again. Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!",2
"If you want cheap and authentic dumplings, this is THE place to go! I ran across this place on multiple sites when searching for places to eat in Toronto so expectations were very high. And the place did NOT disappoint!   Food - absolutely delicious. Especially the soup dumplings. 11/10  Service - fast and accurate. 10/10  Interior - super packed. Very hard to actually get a table. But cute layout! 5/10  I ate at this place three times while on a 5 day trip to Toronto, which simply speaks to how good this place was! I'm convinced this place is packed regardless of the time of day. There was never an instance in which I walked into an empty or partially empty store. I would recommend just taking out from here since it's so packed! But definitely stop by in Toronto!!!",2
"I think I have found a favorite place for food if you're on a budget, and also as a student! Located around Dragon City Mall at Chinatown, this is a popular quick eats place for delicious soup dumplings as low as $2.99 for 6! There are limited seats inside, and by the window, however since it's a quick meal, people tend to leave pretty quickly. Their menu offers a variety of soup dumplings, rice and also juicy fried buns. One thing I don't usually see in other Shanghai restaurant is pan fried versions of soup dumplings, so I definitely had to make an order of that. After ordering with the cashier, you will get a beeper that will ring when youre order's ready.  The food came fairly quickly after ordering. The soup dumplings are what youd get at regular Shanghai restaurants; super juicy and tasty!! I was honestly so surprised how delicious they were as I was skeptical at first due to the low price. The fried juicy buns were a bit small compared to other places, but for the price, you cant complain, and plus they were also very juicy inside as well. The pan fried soup dumplings were also surprisingly juicy as well as I was worried the heat from pan frying them would take it away. All in all, we ordered 4 things and the bill came up to be $16!",2
"This restaurant is SO hard to find. After walking around the dragon city mall numerous times, we finally found the entrance.   The ambiance of this restaurant is very fast food style which is unique for the style of food they serve. As we wanted a light lunch, we ordered two pork xiao long bao and one order crullers. We thought the total would have been average for lunch in Toronto, but it was less than $10 for two people (as it's a light lunch) .   Seating is a bit difficult to come by and it seems to be chaos since some patrons are not very courteous. This doesn't seem to be a new topic though since the location is small.   The pork xiao long baos were better than expected, considering that it was only $3 and came from a fast food place. The crullers were hot and crispy- just perfect.   This place takes credit card, serves hot food and is decently priced. I'd say that's a win. You won't be disappointed - order as much or as little as you'd like",2
"Honestly the best place to go if you're looking for something very inexpensive, fast, and still very good. It was quite crowded on a Friday night but people were coming and going fast enough that we were still able to find a seat.  The soup dumplings were good but the pan fried dumplings were even better. Definitely recommend.  This place is very popular and after trying it for myself, I know why.",2
"I can not stress how much i love this place enough! Located on dundas and spadina in dragon city mall, this place is a hidden gem!  Dumplings are one of my go to snacks or quick meals and i really like the takeout joint concept. It's an ideal place to grab a quick meal in-between classes whenever i have a long day.  The dumplings are so good, so fresh! My childhood favourite is the steamed xiao long bao and it still is today, and this place serves one of the best ones i've had in downtown toronto. I've also tried the pan fried soup dumplings (basically xiao long bao with a pan-fried bottom) and loved them! I've been wanting to try more items from the menu but whenever I go here i always end up getting the xiao long bao for some reason.  They also have a wide range of sauces on the side so you can choose whatever you want to dip your dumplings in. Some of the condiments they provide are vinegar, soy sauce, and sriracha.  I also need to talk about the price. When i first went here, i was honestly so surprised when i saw the prices! They're super affordable (2.99 for 6 xiao long baos), which is a REALLY good deal especially in downtown toronto.",2
"It's an interesting concept to see for fast food dumplings. It wasn't bad nor was it really good, but it was perfectly fine for a quick grab and go lunch.   They all look so delicious, but when it came out, it was clear that it was either made hours before and reheated or just has been sitting out for a while..none of our dumplings were piping hot, and neither was the Soup inside the soup dumplings, which was a bummer.   The fried chicken was hot and good, but we also ordered the mini sesame balls that tasted a bit like there was some chemical in there and it wasn't fully cooked through-- super gross.",1
"6 soup dumplings for $2.99??? Crazy fast service? Seating indoors? What's not to love ?!  We actually passed this place after dinner but the low price of the soup dumplings was too hard to pass by. I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the dumplings. There was ample soup  within the dumplings, and you could get the soy sauce/vinegar on your  own. Well worth a late night trip  here!",2
"Soup dumpling central. This place has the works and everything was a pretty good deal. Easy to order at the front as soon as you walk in.   I ordered quite a lot soup dumplings and pan fried dumplings. They also have soup dumplings that are slightly seared on the bottom which are different from the pan fried. All of them were so good. Comparable to the famous Din Tai Fung but cheaper. Walking in the slushy, cold snow to get here was totally worth it.   If I were with other people, I would have also tried their cumin fried chicken, but that will have to wait til next time. If you come to Toronto and want cheap eats, this is definitely a must!",2
"It's been a while since I had good dim sum.  My favorite was this place in Seattle (can't remember the name, but it's a chain out of LA) with my cousin.   This place was smaller with a small menu. But the options were good and everything I got was delicious!  This place was packed! It's a small hole in the wall with very few tables. I was lucky I found a spot to sit! The wait for my food was pretty long, but that was expected with how long the line was!  I got the pork soup dumplings and the chicken pan fried dumplings. Everything was fairly priced. The dumplings I got were really tasty! Hit them with some soy sauce and they're pretty good!  The pork soup dumplings were the best part! The chicken dumplings had a bit of an odd texture, but were still good.  Give this place a try!",2
"I can't even begin to describe how delicious these ""JUICY DUMPLINGS"" are! (Yes I just did that)  It was a Monday afternoon around 4PM in Toronto and I wanted to grab something small to eat while my friends wanted to grab a Bahn Mi. Not craving a bahn mi, I decided to go on yelp to find something small that would temporarily fill me up before dinner at 7PM. First thing that popped up for me was this place. I noticed that the prices were relativelyo inexpensive so I was skeptical on the taste. How often do you get to pay less for good food?!?  I ordered the Pan fried mini soup dumpling (Pork) for only 3.99 CA. Yes that's right. Only 3.99CA! The moment I took my first bite into the soup dumpling, I felt like I was in Heaven. It was a juicy, delicious, tasteful, and mouth watering soup dumpling I have ever tasted. It was just so perfect. I regret not ordering more!! My friend ordered the steamed mini soup dumpling and we traded one of the soup dumplings with each other. She also LOVED the pan fried mini soup dumpling!  The place was spacious but didn't have that many seats. Since we got there early-ish, there were enough seats for us.  This is a good place for a quick bite! Will most definitely come back here when I visit Toronto again!",2
"Don't let the low price fool you, those 3$ dumplings are worth at least 6$! Juicy made the perfect end to an evening, after having a few drinks at a bar nearby. Came her by recommendation from a local friend, and I'm glad we did!   Arrived around 11:30 pm and the place was packed! Lots of people getting takeout but also groups just hanging out. We had to see what the 3$ dumplings were all about, and to our surprise, they were really good! They are indeed juicy. The texture of the bun is thin and chewy, and right when you bite in you're hit with the hot pork broth that is really flavorful! Perfectly bite size as well, so it makes it super easy to pop the whole thing in your mouth.   We didn't get the opportunity to try anything else as I was pretty full from dinner we had not long before, but next time I'm in Toronto, I know where I'm heading for those late night cravings.",2
"It's cheap, it's fast, it's dumplings!!  I can definitely get behind quick serve dumpling places.  These should be all over the city and would love to see them in more food courts.  I've paid way more for worse dumplings before.  This has got to be considered for one of the best cheap eats in the city.",2
"LUNCH  Just finished eating Rasta Pasta and was walking by, when my eyes caught wind if the giant JUICY DUMPLiNG logo.   I remember bookmarking this place for quite a while now and what true yelper can walk by a bookmarked place and not try it? Not one!  This place is the McDonald's of dumplings! Its fast, affordable and delicious!   So glad my eyes convinced my stomach to try it out. I ordered the soup filled pork dumplings and it was honestly as good as the dumplings I've had at DTF in Shanghai.   You guys gotta try for yourself, but imo dont order ubereats or foodora, you have to try it straight outta the steamer to get the real real, and that can only be accomplished in person! ;)",2
"Location/Service This place is near Spadina, a slight off West of Chinatown. You can't miss the place cause there are big arrows and a large entrance sign noting where it is.   Inside is relatively big, where there's good seating available and also a good assembly line to order and take out.   Staff can speak Mandarin, okay nice, and very fast with orders (especially having a pager system).   Food Came here for a quick snack, which one of their top item is the $2.99 six piece dumpling. For that price, even if it's a little bland, it's justifiable. But to my surprise, the dumplings were in fact juicy! You can see clearly that the skin was thin, and when you taste it, it's packed with a good amount of meat and juice. They're not huge, but good enough to enjoy as a bite size. They also provide soy sauce to make it more flavourful if required.   Definitely took me by surprise at this place. Although I didn't get the opportunity to try other items, but worth coming back to eat the dumplings (in fact, getting a dozen for the price range)!",2
"If you want something quick and fast, and you want soup dumplings. This is the place to go. They serve food like it is fast food but the quality is perfect. You order your food at the counter, the menu is limited but worth trying everything. The prices are really cheap as well, and as for the quality, the soup dumplings were pretty good.  After you order your food they give you a buzzer, as I would call it. You take a sit and wait for the buzzer to vibrate. You grab your food, get your condiments and bon appetite.  So if you are in the area and want some fast soup dumpling, definitely check this place out. Will be worth your time.",2
"This is probably the best restaurant I've been to in the past year. Hands down.   It's cheap. It's somewhat fast. And have I said that I absolutely LOVE the xiao long bao there?? It's crazy. Mind you, I have the taste buds of a college student who usually cooks his own food (poorly); therefore, I see even a McDonald's as a delicacy. But for REAL the food at Juicy Dumpling is f u e g o.   What I ordered:   - S1 Soup Dumpings (6) for $3  I ordered 4 more orders after the first time I went.  Service: These ppl literally don't care about the customers but that's okay cus what asian establishment does?  Seating: Barely any but they pack all of the food in paper boxes regardless so it's easy to travel with them.",2
"Food: 5 Price: $ Interior: 4   We had lunch at another fancier restaurant in the area - Asian Legend and ordered the crab pork dumplings, that is incomparable to crab pork dumplings served in Juicy Dumpling - the fast food place here.  The crab and pork dumplings here are soooo delicious, and at very affordable price point.  We ordered a regular pork dumpling ($3) and a crab+pork dumpling ($6), both are very juicy, and extremely delicious.. comparable to the ones we had in China, or New York's Spring Deer Restaurant.  Wished I had more room in my tummy to get more of it.  This place deserves a Michellin recommendation.",2
"This place is magic. So cheap, and so tasty. Sorry Mother's, but this place just ate your lunch.  One really cool thing seemed to happen when I was there - someone came in to pick up an order, and brought her own reusable containers. There was some back and forth, I think about how they had been cleaned, but sure enough, they went back to the kitchen and out came her order packed to go.  It's more of a fast food type setup than Mother's, but there's a bit of seating, and you can sit and eat no problem. The menu's just on display screens, from what I could tell, but it had a good number of options.   And the prices are outstanding value.",2
"One of best places for Chinese hand-pulled noodles in downtown Toronto.  In this special period, only take-out and delivery are acceptable. The quality of meat and noodles are always stable for delivery. Besides, they put the hot Chili oil on the side for you so you can customize it.",2
Tight spot but delicious food so still 5 stars.  Ordered side dishes of daikon and spicy cucumber and the plates were full and piled high.  Got a small bowl of lanzhou beef noodles (medium wide). Perfect amount of food with lots of flavour. Add your own chilli oil for your desired level of spicy.,2
"I've been to GB two times now and it's one of my favorite restaurants in the world! It is a tiny restaurant but the food is absolutely delicious and is a MUST if you are visiting Toronto (I am an out of towner).   The portion size is huge and the price is right. Honestly, you can order anything and be happy. There aren't many options but you do get to pick the size of noodle that you want. My boyfriend and I shared our dishes and they were perfect for a Toronto winter day. In the front, they even have the chef behind a clear glass so you can see him making the noodles! If you want good food and are visiting Toronto, this is the place to go. I can't wait to be back!",2
"GB Hand-pulled Noodles truly has the best hand pulled noodles in the area! Even though the place is small and stuffy sometimes, I keep on coming back because of the food. GB's noodles are made fresh to order and they are delightful - love the texture! I've literally tried all of the noodle dishes on the menu and I absolutely love all of them.  First of all, the beef noodle is great, the broth is so flavourful! It comes in various sizes but I think that the small one is big enough for me. I would say my favourite soup noodle from GB is the Braised Beef Tendon Noodles, but sadly they only have that on Fridays and weekends. They are pretty generous on the amount of beef tendon they give. My most recent visit was during my vegetarian week - so I tried the vegetable noodles with vegetable broth. It was pretty good, and it definitely still hits the spot even without beef!  They also have dry noodles, my favourite has to be the pork sauce. Their pork sauce is very tasty (a little bit salty though, but it's perfect after you mix everything with the noodles!) and the vegetables they provide in the noodle definitely helped to balance it all out. Their tomato egg is alright too, but it does not stand out as much. For all of the dishes you can choose your noodle type/width. I usually go for either flat or the widest one! It's also worth mentioning that for the price, the portion size is really good. Most of the time I can't finish the noodles except when I'm starving. They also have a lot of side dishes - the side dish menu has really expanded since my last visit. I love the jellyfish and the seaweed salad!  Service is quick and efficient too, it's not the best but it's one of the better ones for fast-paced restaurants like this in downtown Toronto. 10/10 would recommend :)",2
"If you have ever craved noodle soup in any shape or form, you have to stop into GB.  There aren't too many choices here -- the majority of the menu is some kind of Lanzhou beef noodle soup. The only differing factors will be the bowl size, type of meat, spice level, and noodle thickness.  The broth is clear, perfectly seasoned, and the right amount of beefiness -- not super salty or thick like you would find in a ramen broth, and also not dark like a pho broth. It's such a good comfort food on a chilly day.  The noodles are hand-pulled, so whichever you choose, it's bound to have the consistency of freshly made noods. For those of you who like more chew in your noodles, opt for wider.",2
"Special Lanzhou Noodles with Beef // GB Hand Pulled Noodles. -- This place is really small, so there was a decent line  around noon. It's best not to come here with more than 3 people. At the front of the store, you can see the noodles being made as orders come in (I.e. you can see someone physically making the noodles). Pictured here are my friends extra wide noodles. I got the thick noodles (circular with a big diameter). I would recommend the extra wide noodles tbh, because the extra thick ones had a doughy taste when I chewed it since the soup wasn't able to penetrate into the noodle. The extra wide noodles have more surface area exposed to the broth, so each bite would be more flavourful! Also, they have extra chili oil on the side if you want to make it spicier! I actually found it to be at a good level of spice. Overall a decent portion, and they didn't cheap out on the beef.",2
"I have to give credit where credit is due - GB Noodles is the restaurant that made me a noodle-soup fan. I lived in China from 2015-2017, and while I was there, I didn't find a noodle soup I enjoyed.   GB Noodles changed all of that. I used to love coming here. It was consistently delicious.  I'm not sure what's changed, but it definitely isn't the soup I remember. It's still good, don't get me wrong, but after coming back for the first time in about a year, I'm just not sure what's changed. The broth is decent, the noodles are still fantastic, but the overall effect left me a bit wanting.",1
"Decided to try this place since we've heard so many good things about it, and to see if its up there on my list of best beef noodle soups in Toronto.   We ended up getting the mega beef noodle soup because it seemed like the best thing to share between two people. But honestly, if you were hungry enough you could probably finish it on your own.   Noodles are hand pulled in store, and you can choose the lenght/thickness or style you wanted your noodles to be. We opted for the round thin noodles. The broth is nice and light but it still has body. You can really taste the beefiness. The parsley and green onion help cut through the rich soup. One of my favourite things here actually was not part of the noodle itself. But rather it was the chilli oil. The chilli oil was delicious and I probably finished half of the container by myself.   Honestly overall it was pretty good, but it didn't blow my mind. Solid beef noodle soup and awesome hand pulled noodles. 10/10 would come again.",2
"Tiny tiny place and hot as heckkkk.  They have fans running, but with an open kitchen, hot soup as their main sell, and small space with filled up seats of human body heat... it is HOT inside.  Service is overall good, but you do have to flag down the servers as they are busy. No biggie though since the place is so small, you don't have to try hard to get their attention.   Boyfriend and I ordered the Mega beef bowl with flat noodles and spicy cucumber side dish. The food came out relatively quickly and it came out piping hot (yessss). The broth was a 3.5/5, the meat was a 5/5 the noodles was a 4/5, cucumber was a solid 5/5. The broth was just okay flavorful... but the beef was wow. so soft and so flavorful. Really enjoyed the meal overall.   We really enjoyed watching the noodle master hand pull the noodles. We sat at the bar so we had good viewing of him stretching, pulling, twirling, and cutting them. Time to time, he gave the whole store a scare with him throwing the heavy batch onto the counter top so be aware that randomly, you will hear a giant BANG repeatedly (not for long though!)  All in all, great place to stop by! definitely recommend it.",2
"Noodles made to order with your meal, that's awesome. It's a very small shop and so I was fortunate to arrive as a seat at the window opened up. This meant that I had my back to the kitchen and didn't get a chance to watch the noodles being prepared. I did get to *hear* them with the occasional loud bang as they were slammed to the table. If loud noises will make you uncomfortable, then get yours to go.  I chose the regular ""Special Lanzhou Beef Noodles"" in the ""large"" size with my noodles as narrow. Yes, you get to choose from super thin to narrow to thick, flat, medium wide and extremely wide. I enjoyed mine and would like to try the super thin next time.  The soup was delicious with a rich broth and the noodles were delicious. Not spicy at all, I added a good sized spoon of chili paste from the condiments at my seat and that kicked up the flavor. Delicious.  No beer here. They do have a number of vegetarian options.  [Review 11021 overall, 794 of 2019.]",2
"Come here for a quick, satisfying bowl of noods. We were in and out in 35-40 minutes!   We both ordered the Lanzhou Beef Noodles. Delish!  - You can customize the bowl size, the noodle type and spice level.  - Size S is perfect for a good portion. Size L is massive if you're hungry. - We both got the thin noodles and thought they were good but a touch too chewy (not sure if we should attribute to the fact we came so late).  TLDR; Broth was delicious. Beef was flavorful and tender. Noods too chewy. Very quick service.",2
"Love hand pulled noodles! Love that you can choose the width of the noodles. The bowls are huge! Super casual, just good old comfort food.",2
"Cheap and delicious, two of my favourite words, accurately describe GB Hand-Pulled Noodles.  As is typically the case, places like this come with its sacrifices. For starters, there was a line out the door when I strolled in one Saturday for lunch with friends.   We were eventually seated, though I found the tables quite packed together - they really maximized the space....to the detriment of comfort.   The food makes up for it - I tried the thick beef noodles and they were some of the best I've had. Plus, you can even see your noodles getting pulled and freshly cooked.  But, before you're even finished your delicious bowl, you'll find waiters beginning to clean your table and dropping you the bill - you'll definitely feel rushed when eating here.",1
"This place is uber busy during the lunch rush, there's usually a line, though it does move pretty fast. It was also very cramped inside and difficult to maneuver without bumping into ppl. Other than that, this place had a solid bowl of beef noodles. I asked wht the waiter recommended and tbh i can't remember which one we got--it was a few months ago. But tbh id prefer mei nung beef noodle house in markham. I'd come back here if i'm looking for noodle soup dt.",2
"Got there on a Friday around 12:30 so I waited about 15 minutes for a table for 2. Hubby and I split a mega special Lanzhou beef noodle with the picked daikon radish side and jellyfish side.  Broth is perfectly seasoned (I asked for them to make it spicy and to add green onions and coriander/cilantro). Broth may seem bland to a lot of non-Asians but it was just right because of eating it with aforementioned side dishes.   The noodle makers scared the $hit out of me when I was waiting in line because they didn't start pounding the noodles until about 10 minutes in.   Paying bill is easy, multiple card readers on hand.",2
Wanted to try this place for a while went today in the afternoon and it was insanely packed got a seat and the stool and we can see through the window the gentleman making noodles in front of our eyes. I got the thick noodle beef spicy large which was massive. The broth was super tasty and the chilli oil was spicy but not to spicy. The noodles were soft and not gummy the beef was perfectly cooked and not chewy. The soup came nice and hot. Overall a wonderful experience and also it wasn't to filling as well which was perfect,2
"This place is conveniently located a couple blocks from Dundas TTC station. It is also a block from Eaton Centre. The place is a bit crammed and a bit small, so be sure to give some waiting time if you are going at noon.  We ordered the special Lanzhou beef noodles. There are a variety of noodle options in varying thickness. The portions are sufficient for some people, but as I am a big eater, I wasn't full from the large. The noodles are good. The soup is a bit bland. And the beef isn't quite flavourful. There is not much memorable about this place, except that the prices are quite unreasonable with respect to the quality.  Overall, I would not recommend this place, but I haven't yet come across a good place for hand-pulled noodles to recommend.",1
"I was craving for noodle so we saw this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. We came at lunch time and there were a lot of people in the line  15-20 people, but the line move really quick so we ended up wait around 15'. Why I was waiting in line, I got to watch the people inside hand made the noodle, that was so awesome and how much work that put in to have a yummy bowl of noodle. We decided to try the big bowl of beef noodle. The noodle is really good, we chose the thick noodle and not so chewy. The soup was tasty and add a little bit spicy to it, it was so good.",2
"This is a small shop located near my house so I often come here for hand pulled noodles. The portion sizes are pretty big so usually a small is good enough for me.  I like to get the flat noodle because I find it to be chewier which I like! The broth is also really nice. They don't have too many options though, so the menu is just pretty simple!",2
"This was my first time ever getting hand-pulled noodles. The broth was lovely - reminded me of pho. I ordered the super thin noodles, & it seemed almost over cooked as they were too soft. I suppose this might just be because they're super fresh, so there's no way to make them more al dente. I found because it's hand pulled, the size consistency of the noodles were off. There were thicker noodles mixed in, so it threw me off. This is most likely all PREFERENCE based.. but the beef was GREAT & the flavours of the broth and addition of green onions and cilantro.",1
"Be warned that if you come here your meal will be really spicy hot as their name indicates. Don't come here if you can't handle the heat. There's not much on the menu that's not hot - but for those that love that addicting numbing feeling of Sichuan spice then this is the place for you. The one dish I've had that's not spicy is their garlic pea sprouts - wow I didn't even know that pea sprouts was a vegetable that ppl ate but now it's my fav veggie lol.   I see some complaints about the fish being full of bone and I also had that complaint previously  however they've since changed the way they serve the fish and now there are no longer any bones in the pickled cabbage fish hotpot.  This place is definitely one of my favourite Sichuan restaurants downtown.   The service is ok, sometimes a slow...and service quality depends on who you have, the guy is a bit rude and most of the girls are nice but like who goes to chinese restaurants for the service lol  (if you do...well you shouldn't).",2
"Dining here on a Saturday night was a 30 mins wait on the waitlist for a group of four. There was a small waiting area so it wasn't terrible but heads up, the place is pretty noisy  We ordered the ""boiled clams"", the ""Sichuan Picked Flavoured Beef in soup"", and their iced plum green tea  The clams were def a hit and a very reasonable price ($8) we really enjoyed the flavour and quality of the dish  The beef soup sadly was a ""miss"", the beef shavings were decent quality but the taste wasn't enjoyable. Too many peppercorns were left in the dish and slightly tasted off ( I'm unsure if stale or...)   Tbh the spice level is manageable and not over the top, I just found the flavour to be subpar for Sichuan soup dishes   The plum green tea isn't a fave either, extremely sweet and diluted (tastes like a watered down freezie )",1
"I recently checked out Hotopia with my friend because we wanted to try their sichuan pickled flavour fish soup.  You can choose different kinds of fish like basa fish.  We ended up with Tilapia.  The pot that came was big enough for 2 to 3 people.  My friend and I didn't manage to finish the pot.  The soup was actually pretty good.  It was more sour than spicy, but I liked the mix of flavours.  The Tilapia unfortunately was overly filled with bones.  I was surprised by this.  The staff didn't caution us about the bones, so we ended up spending the evening spitting them out, which was not my idea of an enjoyable meal.   Maybe there is an alternative without bones.  I would like to go back and check out other dishes on the menu.  It's a fairly new restaurant, and was pretty packed when we were there.  But service was prompt.",0
"Nice staff Simple interior About $20 for king pao w rice; restaurants love to add $$$$ for the rice, they know it goes with rice, so charge more, seems unfair. It is definitely hot. Felt like CRAP hour(s) later. Hard on the stomach, I like hot, this was too greasy and doesn't sit well. Did I mention 4 hrs later.. Not so good! Bad aftertaste and guts are mad at me.",0
"Authentic Sichuan style restaurant in Downtown Toronto. The spicy level is more inclined to salty flavour instead of pure spicy one. In this case, it is more acceptable for most of customers. The two dishes we ordered are all pretty good. Personally I prefer the dry pot vegetables dish and all different type of vegetables melts in the dry hot pot in great harmony. Some tips: save your time if you join in the yelp waitlist before your arrival. It can at least save you 15-min waiting time.",2
"This place has everything I want in a downtown Chinese restaurant: -Genuine & delicious Chinese food -Cool atmosphere and modern internal decor -BIG portion with not so expensive price -CLEAN and tidy  If you order any of the bowl, it is sufficient for two by itself for a price of $28-30. My girlfriend and I had so much leftovers at the end that it can be another meal later.",2
"This place is outside College TTC Station and near many stores.   We ordered the item with the least peppers, but it was super spicy still. It was quite flavourful. The pickled veggies added a nice touch, and the fish was tender. But it was too spicy for me. Of course you can ask them to try to make it less spicy. It was still yummy though so I'm okay with the spicy.  Overall, it's a neat place to go to try Sichuan-style hot pot with fish in Downtown Toronto.",2
"I walk by Hotopia most days on my way home from work, and if you've ever passed by, you've probably smelled that strongggg spicy spice from outside. Maybe just walking by has even cleared your sinuses. It's been packed (usually with a line up) most nights when I've passed by which is why I've waited so long to check it out, but a few friends and I finally made our way here for dinner this past Sunday. I put my name on the Yelp waitlist for five people for 6pm, which turned out to be unnecessary as there were several empty tables when we arrived. (The restaurant got busy later around 7pm, and there were a few groups waiting for tables).  We have varying levels of spice tolerance between the five of us, so we ordered three dishes to share: pea sprouts in broth, steamed chicken with chili sauce, and the Sichuan pepper numb basa. The pea sprouts were the only non-spicy dish we ordered, and it was pretty standard as far as Chinese pea sprout dishes go (including the high price point). The steamed chicken wasn't too spicy and quite oily - watch out for the bones! The Sichuan pepper numb basa was the main dish that we ate with rice - it's definitely spicy, but not too numbing (as long as you avoid actually eating the peppercorns themselves, which I definitely did). There were quite a lot of pieces of basa as well as eggplant, and despite sweating and turning red from the spice, we found ourselves finishing everything.   Service is pretty friendly, and they were fast to fill up our water (which we definitely needed). The bill came to ~$14 per person which was pretty decent for such a filling meal. This isn't my favorite type of Chinese cuisine as I'll admit, I can't really handle the heat. But I'm definitely interested in coming back to try some other dishes!",1
"I have heard tons of good things about hotopia before this location even opened, and I finally got to try it with my friends. We heard the default spicy level (which is 2) for the mala pot is too spicy, but apparently my friend who told me that is a baby lol. I don't eat very spicy but this is definitely not spicy at all, I would suggest go for level 3. We ordered the marrying four pot, funny name huh, but it has beef sirloin, pork, lamb and shrimp, which basically saves u lots of decisions! We also added lotus root, beef balls, and rice cake. The rice cake was a great add on , it's crispy outside and soft inside, it absorbs the flavors and it's amazing! Even though it is not that spicy, I definitely think it is very very delicious, I would definitely come back again to try more dishes! We also ordered stir fry potato, it's warm and spicy, it's great!",2
Awesome! We had dinner in Chinatown & I was disappointed in the quality of the food. I am happy that we found this place on our last day.   We split the Sichuan pickle flavored basa & it was outstanding! The fish tasted fresh & the soup was very flavorful. My wife loved the peach tea too.,2
"A bit of a waiting period but the turnaround was not bad at all, we only waited like 15 mins-ish with 6 people ahead of us.  Good vibe, service was only okay because it took them too long to come around and take our order.  But the taste, IT IS AMAZING!!! Very authentic Chinese food downtown. Definitely recommend u to go try!",2
"Fantastic Sichuan food in downtown Toronto.  The new hot(literally) spot for some good Sichuan Chinese food.  Went for dinner with friends and ordered beef and tripe, Tilapia hotpot, chicken wings pot, bean sprouts, everything is delish and Tilapia pot the special is quite unique with Sichuan style pickled veggie. The dish has daily limits till sold out, we were lucky to have got our order in. But you do need to watch out for the fish bones because they use fresh fish instead of fillets (which is a huge plus if you want authenticity). The most popular dish on our table was the chicken wings however, the lotus root add on (some of the dishes are highly customizable) is to die for. However, it is really spicy, suicidal spicy. For folks who think they might be able to handle spicy, you definitely won't be able to. Ask the staff to really tone down the spice level to almost none, and it'll be spicy enough for like 99% of general population. Will def go back.",2
"It basically just tastes like a hotpot you can make at home without the hassle! I loved the curry fried rice - good flavour and portion for the price. Great service. FYI One hotpot thing is good for 2 people, so the price is alright for eating downtown.",2
"I've been here once before and had a good experience. The pickled cabbage beef soup was plentiful for two people and we had enough to EACH take home for a second meal. Everything was delicious and I craved it everyday until I went again.   The second time, there was barely anything in the soup and they forgot the pickled cabbage...the pickled cabbage that's in the name! I brought it to a waiter's attention and she had the audacity to just bring it out in a bowl, did not offer for the kitchen to add it to the soup and recook it. Very disappointed. At checkout they did offer 10% off without me having to do anything, which was nice. But still. How do you forget one of main ingredients?!",1
Horrible service. I used Yelp waitlist feature and arrived on time. We stood by the door for 20 minutes and nobody bothered to check on us. All the servers were chatting amongst themselves. No single exchange of words at all with their customers.,0
"Not for everyone, maybe an acquired taste. Had the Sichuan pickled basa as per other reviews and the flavours were just too strong. It would be nice to have a smaller portion version so new customers could try a wider spread and not feel so locked in. The single large $30 slightly tongue numbing, gingery sour soup was too much of a commitment for two people. Good initial taste but then it just becomes overwhelming. Definitely need a lot of rice for this dish.",0
Best Sichuan food in town. But it always take too long to wait. Both settled and served.,2
"this is probably the best Sichuan restaurant I had in Toronto. You can basically order any dish from the menu, it won't go wrong.",2
Poor service. Extremely slow. You have to wait for 30 minutes to be sited and another 40 minutes for your food. Will not come back,0
Great place! Fabulous taste and clean environment! The fish is so fresh and with big portion!,2
"I have never been to a place with king crab tanks all around the entire restaurant!  If you want fresh seafood in front of your eyes, this is the place!  So many options to choose from and between us 6, we chose the crab and lobster and they make it into different entrees.  It was a great experience and we had leftovers as well. Some of the entrees were a little bland, but everything else definitely had some good flavors, sweet, and fresh!",2
"Another year has passed by and the HK-style ""Lobster Mountain"" is now back with a mix of fries & fried anchovies. This was a pleasant surprise as they did away with the anchovies/smelt fish citing rising costs several years ago. It caused a bit of a stir, but now the mix is the best of both worlds: east meets west fusion! Kids certainly don't mind the fries. So it's great when restaurants listen to customer feedback.  Fishman Lobster Clubhouse is still the place for the ultimate seafood experience at reasonable prices. With a reservation, we were seated shortly upon arrival. Made our order, and a big fresh 5.5 lb lobster was brought to our table for photos. The wok-tossed Lobster Mountain always impresses, not only based on presentation but also because each huge piece is crispy, slightly spicy, and still very succulent and tender. The other dishes also pair well: silkie chicken soup, snow peas, lobster roe fried rice and sea bass which were more than enough for our table of 3. This year dessert was even elevated with macarons; I usually find these treats overly sweet but here it was perfect. No wonder some people come to Toronto just to try this restaurant.  Occasionally, I hear complaints about their no-nonsense service. But they were very courteous despite the fast pace of service for Lunar New Year dinner. Our dishes arrived quickly, tea was replenished, full plates of shells were replaced. Even the leftovers were packed by a smiling waiter. Funniest thing was when another waiter with the bill offered to give us a toony for exact change. He even wished us well for the new year, just amazing service!",2
"My review for Fishman is long overdue.  It's been 3 months, and the food is still all I talk about.    Located on the outskirts of Toronto, we arrived just an hour or so before closing.  It's a restaurant decorated with grandeur.  We had our hearts set on the fried crab legs with garlic (aka the renowned Jenga tower).    Everything on the menu looked delightful so we decided on The King Crab and Lobster Dinner.  This is a meal for 4, mind you.  And we're a party of 2.  We were warned by the young wait staff that it's too much food.  Lol, once you break the price down to per serving, it's definitely a steal!  Our waiter then confirmed with us that it's 6 lbs crab and 5 lbs of lobster!  They brought out the live shellfish for us to take photos (for the 'Gram) and also to confirm the actual weights.    The king crab went into the steamed crab meat with salted eggs, fried rice, and the oh-so-photogenic fried crab legs with fried garlic (Jenga tower).  Both lobsters were used to make the HK-style lobster and fried rice.  Included with our gorge fest was the daily soup and poached snow peas with goji berries.  We threw on the bib, pulled on the gloves, and went to work.  Let me tell you...I would request this meal as my last on this Earth.  The crab legs were so full of flavor.  You see garlic pieces embedded into the shell.  There's also a complex melody of spices.  I found myself nibbling on the shells for the finely-coated batter.  The lobster was just as delicious, with similarly garlicky flavors and spices.  I would say the crab legs edged out the lobster as my favorite since the meat was so succulent.  The crab (knuckles?) in egg was just okay.  It was probably my least favorite.  The greens helped everything go down better.  (At my age, I can't handle as much meat as I used to.)  A couple of the waiters stood by because they offered great service, marveled at how much we've ordered and finished.  My tummy has never been this satisfied.  There's more where that came from!  You can only imagine how much leftovers we had.  Our incredible waiter packed the lobster and the crab into catering trays and takeout containers.  Luckily we were staying at an Airbnb, so we had access to an oven to gently reheat the trays of yumminess.  It turned into 2 more meals lol.  That's 6 servings of an all seafood meal for $388.  I'd say that was an excellent deal for an all seafood dinner.  You can feast like us even if it's been you and a buddy.  Oh, and don't forget to bring cash.  They took our USD no problem.  They don't accept cards!    I'll always have fond memories of Fishman as the best meal I've ever had.  Plus, excellent service.  Despite being the last patrons, we were never rushed but we made an effort to leave as soon as we finished.    There's only this one location in Northern America!  That's a crime IMO!  I'm still searching for a restaurant that's remotely similar to Fishman.  Please send suggestions!",2
"In my opinion, Fishman Lobster is the best Hong Kong-style seafood restaurant in the city. It's a classic and a must-try for Torontonians and when friends and family from out of town visit.   The restaurant itself is a sight to behold with aquariums all around the dining area filled with massive king crabs and lobsters, fish, eels, and other seafood. The dishes are cooked family-style with many different options and most people opt for the crab/lobster mountain with fried garlic - a choice you can't go wrong with! The crustaceans are also broken down and served in several courses such as crab legs crisped shallots and chilies, and decadent fried with the body meat.   The menu has a variety of different combos and you can also customize it according to your group with the help of the staff. They also bring out the massive lobsters and crabs for you to take pictures with which is always fun.  Prices are up there but it's seafood and can be managed by customizing your combos.   Highly recommend and make sure to make reservations!",2
"Stepped into the restaurant and was surrounded by endless tanks of freakishly large crabs. We got the Hong Kong style lobster (4.83 lbs) lunch set that included soup, fried rice, snow pea with goji berries, and dessert. It was nice that we got a bunch of different dishes to try. We also had a lot of food at the end to take home too  Honestly though I started to get sick of the lobster after a few bites since it is fried and quite oily. I ended up eating the veggies/fried rice instead! I also find I prefer lobster fried with ginger and scallion more than HK style. Service was incredibly slow when we went.  Overall I think it was good to try, but I don't know if I would return again. I think it'd be good for special occasions or to treat people that like seafood due to the visual wow factor of the dish though!",1
"Don't get me wrong - this was one of the FANCIEST restaurants my dad has taken my family to. That being said, I feel as if I can be more critical of Fishman Lobster Clubhouse.  What I loved: -The restaurant itself is filled with tanks showcasing live king crabs and lobsters. Makes sense, since customers come here for the seafood. -Service lived up to my expectations. The waitress was even nice enough to bring our crab and lobsters up to our table, so I could take pictures. -The fried crab legs were TO DIE FOR. The meat was so juicy and tender, and the honey fried garlic accompanying the meat offered a wonderful sweet-savory taste. Definitely a stand-out dish to order. -Our family received complimentary macarons at the end of our dinner.   What could be improved: -Seating was cramped. Literally, there was no room for me to even pull my chair out, because the woman behind me was back-to-back against me. -Considering my family and I ordered one of the set dinners, which came with a king crab and 2 lobsters... besides the fried crab legs, all the other dishes (fried lobster, crab fried rice, and steamed crab) were tasteless to me. Arguably, the fried lobster should have tasted very similarly to the fried crab legs, because the chef presumably used the same batter and honey fried garlic to season the dish. Unfortunately, the flavors didn't stand out as much in the lobster dish. Likewise, the rice tasted almost as plain as steamed rice. Steamed crab head is my favorite part of the crab, so I was so upset that the crab head was wasted in the fried rice.   My family and I arrived around 5:30 PM, so we were lucky enough to find a table pretty easy. I will say, however, that the restaurant got packed super quickly, so unless you make a reservation or arrive on the earlier side like my family did, be prepared to wait before you're seated. Additionally, don't be surprised to find a lot of richer folks in the restaurant. After all, the price point at Fishman Lobster Clubhouse is pretty high.  Otherwise, a great place to enjoy some luxurious seafood.",2
"419$ or $60 per person this meal is  SO worth it. Whatever the occasion! Always packed with people but so worth it.  Food: 4.5/5 Service: 4/5 Ambience: 4/5 Cost: 6/5 ---  yes it's worth it  We came to eat with 7 people and 420$, we ordered 25 pounds of lobster, 2 entrees, 1 vegetable, 1 soup, a tray of macaroons!! And 1 bottle of wine (which we switched for 10 cans of pop Cause we didnt drink)  We walked in to it being super full, we booked a reservation at 9:30 on a saturday night, we didnt even find parking lol. We waited another 20 minutes before we could order.  The food was perfect,  25 pounds if lobster stacked in a tower form filled with fries and lettuce it was a sight to see. The meat was great, although not very flavorful the large chunks of lobster made it worth every bite.  The 2 entrees came first, sweet and sour pork fresh hot and crispy, the beefs with vegetables was cooked beautifully medium rare. They made sure to serve it first because god knows we dived into that lobster as quick as can be.  Soup was okay and nothing fancy.  It come with a tray of macaroons!!! How awesome!! Although it didnt taste phenomenal just the worth it price of these makes it so much better.  The service was great, they come very often to change plates, let us stay longer just to chat after they closed and take our pictures, and went out of their way to explain everything!!  I really fell inlove with this place and I can really see how many fans they really have.  You dont need a lot of people to eat there, I see tables of pairs of 2 to families of 10 and more.   Our bill came to 419$ for 7 people. I would say it was worth every dollar!",2
"Such an amazing experience! We enjoyed our dinner last night for my husband's 40th bday! The food was amazing! The layout of the restaurant was excellent with crabs and lobsters in fish tanks; like Red lobster on steroids!   If you're from America, they only take Canadian debit/credit/cash or American Dollar, heads up!  We were brought or shall I say they dragged a grey bucket to our table with a 6lb king crab to get our approval and we chose three different styles of flavors. Then, they brought plate by plate our meals and it was sooooo much food for two. The style is family sharing like most authentic Asian restaurants!   My husband and I did well, actually he did well I just assisted! This is a must eat restaurant! The veggies they bring are just fillers though, I love veggies but they were flavorless! So they remained on the plate while the star of the show was defeated!  What I loved was there were plenty of waiters to help at all time, they went from table to table to check on you. But, we had one whi looked as if he was a manager and he was awesome. He gave amazing tips on what to order and we were satisfied on our choices. He wore a blue shirt instead of a black shirt, so I'm figuring he was management!",2
"Put this place at the top of my list to try in Toronto, and it did not disappoint. The place is huge! If you have a large party, I would recommend making a reservation. There are so many options to choose from, but we went with the lobster tower (4 course meal). This includes, snow pea leaves, lobster tower, fried rice and dessert which was just macarons. The lobster tower was delicious! So much flavor! No sauce needed. The service was really nice, they came by and changed our plates and asked us what we needed a couple of times.    Note: It is cash only!",2
"I love this seafood place it honestly was amazing I loved the food it was very delicious, a little messy but they give you gloves on the table, with some nutcrackers and crab forks.  The service was very good, friendly and professional, and this place is a lot bigger than I thought. They have lots of seating, an array of dishes and price points to choose from and overall the dishes are filling so come on an empty stomach!  I would highly recommend this place, but ofc be aware of the prices and look at the menu ahead of time. They have lots of parking at the back as well.",2
"Overall: great seafood and service   Little on the pricey side but worth for a special occasion.   Food HK style lobster: great flavor, meat was very tender, sweet and filled with flavor",2
"Came here with a group of my friends. This is definitely a great place to take someone who isn't from toronto. The mountain of lobsters makes for a great photo op! But not only does it make for great IG photos the food is also very good here!   For a table of 8 people we got the lobster and king crab combo that was cooked in 3 ways. I definitely recommend having it cooked different ways otherwise just eating a 30 lb lobster just fried will get tiring and boring fairly fast. We got it cooked fried, steamed stir fried but I must say my favourite was the fried and the soy glazed one! So flavourful and yummy.   They give you gloves to eat with so you don't have to dirty your hands. The food comes very quickly. Our table barely had enough room for everything. The meal also came with fish and fried rice. The fried rice was okay but tbh we were all too focused on the good stuff.   We had a lot of left overs and the meal definitely could have fed at least 3-4 more people. It was a very expensive dinner. The combo itself was $1088 if I remembered correctly.   Service was okay. Parking is a mess there! Definitely so early to get a spot.",2
"Probably 3.5 stars. Overall, this place wasn't bad but I think it's definitely overhyped. It's known for its fresh seafood, namely king crab and lobster. Although you can choose the flavors, the most popular by far is the garlic fried option in which they fry the seafood with tons of garlic and place it on top of a mound of fries. It tasted good, but I feel like by the nature of the dish, it's hard to mess up.   The staff also seems to be trained to upsell at every opportunity. The waitress persuaded us to order the crab/lobster combo which came with 5 lbs of lobster and 6lbs of king crab. When they came out to show us the live seafood, they claimed that they only had crabs that were 7.5 plus lbs so we would have to pay for the extra weight.   The meal itself was good but nothing mind blowing. The soup and dessert (which was just macaroons) were very underwhelming. The crab fried rice also tasted kind of plain and didn't have much crab flavor. I did enjoy the garlic fried lobster and steamed crab legs though.   They automatically add tax and a 10 percent service charge to the bill. They only accept cash and Canadian debit which is crazy considering how pricey the meal is - who carries that much cash around nowadays? You can pay with USD however it will be for an exchange rate slightly lower than market value.   If you are set on trying this place, it may not hurt to come once. But considering a meal for four was almost 600$ I was expecting something much more memorable.",1
What an experience! When you order the lobster they bring it out to show you before cooking so you can see the size of the lobster. The garlic flavour one that we got was scrumptious. Just be ready to spend some money because food isn't cheap here but the quality isn't either. We went on mother's day and they were giving out roses to all the mothers at each table. Such a cute gesture.,2
"I'm not a huge fan of lobster, but if you are, this is the place to be. The lobsters here are ginormous.  We ordered one of the lunch/dinner sets for $299, which apparently feeds 4-6 people. That was an understatement. We had plenty of leftovers, especially with the Lobster Mountain in the mix (fried lobster with garlic bits, dried fish, on top of French fries).   Dinner set included steamed lobster with butter and lemon, the Lobster Mountain, lobster over pea sprouts and noodles, lobster roe fried rice, and a large mouth steamed bass. The traditional steamed lobster with butter and lemon, and the monstrous Lobster Mountain were my favorites.   Overall, we had over twelve pounds of lobster for lunch. Gluttony at it's finest.   Like I said, if you're a lobster lover, 'tis the place to be.",2
"We got the massive 600$ lobster tower that came with a soup, some veggies and a bottle of white wine. The lobsters were huge and it was impressive to look at. They fried it with garlic and onions and it came with fries. Although it was very flavorful and fresh, it became a bit boring to eat the same oily flavor after a few pieces.   The place is huge and it's surrounded by aquariums with their fresh seafood. They show you the lobsters before cooking them. The service was fast and great.   Make sure you reserve before coming.",2
"THE place for lobster, crab, seafood. I really like the deep fried garlic flavor for the crab/lobster and the hk style flavor is my next go to. The deep fried oysters are a delicious as well- the sauce is a little sweet, and the oysters are crispy n plump.  The 4 stars and not 5 stars is because of the dessert macarons at the end of your meal. Personally it's a weird combination- macarons and Chinese food? Also they're not that good",2
"This seafood restaurant is touted as ONE of the most popular places to eat at, and I very much agree! It comes with the caviot that your wallet will take a huge hit..so be prepared to foot a bill between $100~$500 or more.  For context, my total bill came up to $500 and some change for the (E) item on the menu alone, and I came with a family of 5. It DEFINITELY fed all of us with some leftovers for dinner which I'm very satisfied with.  The atmosphere is very pretty as the walls are lined up with lobsters and king crabs in tanks. YOU GET TO TAKE PICTURES OF YOUR LOBSTER & KING CRAB OF CHOICE BEFORE THEY COOK IT! Very spacious restaurant, washroom conveniently found at the entrance, and tables are appropriately sized and spaced out.  Service was very speedy and kind. They often checked in on us to ask if we'd like to exchange our plate full of crab shells for new plate to eat on. Complimentary macarons as oppose to fortune cookies was a nice touch.  Food & taste. For the 1 item we ordered I feel everything was adequately flavoured. The ""steamed crab meat with egg white & salted egg yolk"" may taste slightly bland to some but I think it's a good dish to balance all the other seasoned courses. My favourite is definitely the tower of lobster meat with the spicy french fries!  The one thing that stood out to me above all else is how expensive most items on the menu are. It's not a complaint but surely something to consider when deciding for which course(s) you want to order for your group in the present and future visits.  OVERALL: I highly recommend Fisherman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant! Make RSVPs for your group ahead of time because it gets busy.",2
"This is a restaurant meant for dining in large groups. The food is delicious and good quality seafood, with large quantities, depending on the option you choose. One thing to keep in mind is that the menu options are a bit on the higher budget scale, but the portions are quite good. The highlight dishes are the lobster tower, crab tower, and deep fried oysters.  Make sure to call in advance and reserve a table.",2
"I've been wanting to come here for many years and finally got the chance to this week. Expectations were sky-high and all I can say is that this place delivered! The lobster made HK-style was one of the best dishes I've had this year. Amazing! The soup, fried rice, and snow peas were good but nothing compared to the lobster. For two of us, we got the 6 lbs lobster package that was ~130 CAD before tax and tip. HK-style was $15 but it was worth it. The lobster came on top a bed of delicious French fries.",2
"A brand new dumpling house in the Junction? Yes, yes, YES!  I have to hand it to these lovely people, who opened their restaurant for business in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. I first walked past a few days ago and noticed that they had a spread of carefully folded take out menus packaged in individual clear plastic sleeves on a table just outside the door. I grabbed one and took it home, then after looking at the interesting array of menu items, I called to place an order.   In the space of a few days, I have ordered from them twice now. The food is absolutely delicious - truly authentic northern Chinese selections made with wholesome, quality ingredients (yay Sichuan peppercorns and doubanjiang!) The dumplings are explosive and fresh, the rice and noodle dishes are scrumptious, and the portions are huge for the price!   Finally, the man that works there is SO friendly and kind. The space is spotless and well-organized for clean, touch-free take out.  Please support this burgeoning restaurant! Their food is a welcome addition to the neighbourhood. If you are a fan of real Chinese home cooking, it will not disappoint!",2
"One of the best dumplings  family restaurant!!!  We visited the place about 6 years ago and were super impressed with the food. That was the first time ever I've tried dumplings. In October we were in Toronto and decided to visit this place again. We are still impressed with deliciousness and quality of the food. We ordered several different dishes and they all have been made for us from scratch -- handmade dumplings  are sooooo goooood!!!! If you are in town, make sure stop by that amazing family restaurant!!!!!!!!",2
"Went there because craving for dumplings and saw good reviews online. Their shop is a bit old style but that isn't a matter.  Service: Their understandings of English is really low. I know they're Asian but still communication is key especially running a business. Realized most asian restaurants nowadays required customers to write on a paper for ordering  Food: Food was delicious! Handmade and freshly made to order. Like the chewiness of the noodles and the thinness of the dumplings.  However, they gave me 11 dumplings rather than a dozen. I didn't give a tip because of the poor communication and missing food but they complained about that :/",1
"We came here as part of a dare to eat at a ""shady"" looking restaurant. Surprisingly well worth it. And NOT shady at all, very wholesome vibes.   They were located down the street on Huron, tucked beneath commercial offices. These guys have some pretty fantastic food.   It's a very casual, family-owned asian restaurant, reflective of the cultural neighbourhood. If you're already into that type of thing and want to dine casually, it's a good call.",2
"I've been on a dumpling craze for a while and I finally found a place I absolutely love.  Yummy Yummy Dumpling lives up to it's name. The store is located off of Dundas on Huron St (there's actually a huge sign that directs you to the store). It's located in a basement-like space and is smaller than expected.  The no-frills restaurant is served by a no-frills owner. She has very basic English but is understandable. The menu is quite extensive for such a small place. Vegetarian options are also indicated! You write the order # down on a paper and hand it in. So simple.   The dumplings are freshly made & you can see a lady in the front window steadily hand making them. You can get them boiled, steamed, or pan-fried.  We ordered 1. Sesame Sauce Noodle: This was my least favorite and you can skip it. We thought it would be spicy but nope. This sesame sauce was thick. 2. Squid and Chives Dumpling, Fried; DELICIOUS. A must try. The crispiness of the dumpling was A+. 3. Chicken, Cabbage, and Mushroom, Boiled: YES! Since I don't eat pork and my friend doesn't eat beef - this was a great compromise.  4. Cucumber and Jelly Fish: The jelly fish was a little different than what I was used to. The whole dish was really refreshing.  The price is great for how much we ate. I had left-overs for dinner the next night and they were still pretty good. 100% my fave dumpling place in Chinatown.",2
"Handmade and made to order!! Can't get any fresher than this!   This was and is now officially be the best dumpling ever. Just might be better than din tai fung!   These were handmade to order! Have you ever had handrolled to order? Run by a mom and pop and their son. Located below a tall china town building and next to a sketchy massage parlor and popular hot pot place. That's where I found the best dumplings ever.   Slower than most: everything comes out at different times. Cause they are fresh!! They have noodles and dumplings. Huge menu of dumplings: steamed, boiled, fried, pancake form. They got it all!!   Soup dumplings: the best ones I've tasted!! The best! Poke a hole, let the steam out and bang! Flavortown!! Super tasty!  The potstickers with shrimp and pork were delish. Loved the spicy cucumbers too. And their pan fried buns were so fluffy, it falls apart in your mouth! I got it with shrimp and egg!  Everything was so fresh, you leave happy! And not getting that sick after dumplings feeling: cause it's fresh!   Cash only, never frozen! And pretty much the best thing ever!!!! Totally coming back!",2
Cute family run restaurant in Chinatown. Everything made fresh and speedy. Food is okay. The restaurant is busy but not full.,1
"Another example of ""don't judge a book by its cover."" Yummy Yummy may look slightly run down with its bland looks but the food and service definitely belies its otherwise plain (and dare I say somewhat sketchy?) looks.   First of all, the owner of Yummy Yummy is a really nice lady. She helped pick out items for us when we were having a hard time deciding. It was like having a friend's mom cook for us!   The food itself was authentic and tasted like it was made at home. I really enjoyed the xiao long bao and the potato salad. Pricing was cheap too!   We ended up coming back a second time and will be down for coming back a third time. This place is a must-visit!",2
"Finally found the perfect soup dumplings in toronto ! And yes it beats Mother dumpling and dumpling house. The place is sort of hidden away from the main Chinatown strip on dundas, and is located in the basement so I feel it's hard to find. But once you come here I don't think you'll be going to any other dumpling place. The place is owned by a friendly lady who greets you warmly and attends your table. We tried the juicy pork buns - 10/10 ! And the beef and shrimp dumpling which were also great ! But the highlight of our meal was the beef and onion pancakes - the dough is so uniquely amazing, haven't had anything like it in Toronto. Yummy yummy will definitely become a regular spot for me.",2
Little family friendly run restaurant. Polite staff. Dumplings were amazing. Very fresh and delicious.,2
"Omg.  This place was so good!  I was dying for some dumplings, so I covinced my friend to come join me here after reading some reviews.  Got here at about 12.30 on a Sunday afternoon and it was pretty empty.  We ordered:  Hot and Sour Soup (small, 4.99) Pork shrimp and chive dumplings (9.99) Mixed stir fried veggies (7.99) Beef rolled pancake (9.99)   The soup was average fare, a bit thick  The dumplings were freaking fantastic. The shrimp inside were cooked perfectly. Some of the best I've had in a really long time and they hit that spot.  The veggies were cooked perfect and fresh.  The beef rolled pancake was phenomenal, but super greasy as expected.  By the time our food came though, the restaurant was super packed so that's a great sign!   Portions were huge and we had tons to take home.   I can defo see this becoming my go to spot in Chinatown!",2
"Well, this was a good place to me after the owner said I have to pay 10% tip?   This is not a full service restaurant, I actually had to go to the cashier to pay my bill so I wouldn't understand why I have to pay 10%?  My bill was 37.32 and I have her $40，and I asked her kept the changes and she said it's not enough?  It's totally ridiculous! I wouldn't care if the food good or not. It's really pricey as well.",1
"I was craving soup dumplings and this restaurant has such good reviews that I just had to come here. It's a tiny restaurant down some steps, so it might be hard at first to find if you don't know what you're looking for exactly. There isn't a ton of seats, so if it's busy, you might need to wait for a table.  The restaurant itself could use a huge facelift. The washrooms were dirty and very small. The whole place just feels outdated - minus the tables and chairs. I came on a busy Saturday night but was seated fairly quickly. They cleaned my table before I was seated but the dish cloth they used to wipe the table was definitely used.. my table just smelled like a used dish cloth, sadly. There were also a TON of mosquitos. We were seated right in front the of door, so perhaps this could be why.. but the most odd thing is that they would just drop onto our table and food, and almost die or stop moving instantly. Not sure what was going on.. but it ruined my appetite.   ONTO THE FOOD: the most important reason why I'm reviewing! We ordered the Juicy Pork Dumplings (soup dumplings), fried shrimp & pork dumplings, & chive pancakes. The soup dumplings were just okay. The filling wasn't as flavourful as other ones that I've tried from other places. It was missing something but I can't figure out what it is. The pancakes were really good, and I wish I ate more but they were dripping I grease, so I couldn't eat more than 2. I didn't have any of the fried dumplings but my boyfriend said they were very greasy as well. We actually had to go get a drink from a bar close by just to get rid of the greasy feel in our mouths.  I honestly wouldn't come back here myself. A lot of other people gave this place high reviews so I'm not sure if I just had a bad experience or not. But the greasy food and mosquitos flying around or dropped dead in front of us wasn't acceptable.",0
Apparently closed today Tuesday Oct 22 at 5pm. Sign says closed Wednesday so I'm not sure what's going on,1
"This place is great! Very authentic and delicious dim sum. We got the soup dumplings, pan friend dumplings, fish ball soup and egg drop soup.   Everything was amazing, very flavourful and the service was quick.   I highly recommend this place, especially the soup dumplings.",2
"I was meeting up with a friend for lunch. I let her pick where to eat; she settled on Yummy Yummy Dumplings, which is one of her go to spots for dumplings.  We dropped in on a Tuesday afternoon (around 12:00pm). It was pretty dead but apparently, it's sporadic whether they're busy or not. The good thing is that they make everything fresh. You can see straight into the kitchen all the food being made. When you sit down, you'll be offered hot or cold tea. I also asked for water which came out nice and cold.  The menu is long with soups, appetizers, hot dishes, steamed buns, dumplings, pancakes, noodles, rice & congee and frozen dumplings/buns. Nice to see that dumplings are all the same price whether you get them boiled, steamed or pan fried.  - Rolled beef pancakes (F20) ($8.99) - green onions and slices of beef. Interestingly, they come cut into four pieces and wrapped in tin foil. Never seen that before. Good but the sauce was a tad sweet.  - Xiao long bao (D01) ($7.99 for 6) - these aren't your usual XLB's. Labelling it as an XLB is pretty misleading. It's more so a small steamed bun. It was still good! Tasty filling and soft, fluffy bun.  - Pork & cabbage (E05) ($8.99 for 10) - we got these pan fried. Excellently cooked.  Good little hole in the wall dumpling spot.",2
"Handmade? Check. Made to order? Check. Unassuming decor hiding a mouthwatering culinary experience? Yes!   Better than Din Tai Fung, This wonderful spot is a little subterranean hole in the wall that simply exudes quality and love. Like I said these dumplings are made to order and it shows! They have a wide array of dumplings, along with the usual stuff that you would expect such as scallion pancakes and some noodle dishes (both scrumptious).   Can't wait until I'm back in the 416 so I can go to yummy yummy dumplings!",2
"We came on a Thursday night for dinner. The restaurant is quite small and it is on a basement level, we walked down stairs to get to the front entrance. There were a few tables occupied but many tables still empty so we didn't have to wait.  The restaurant has plain decor and they haven't done much in terms of upgrading furniture and renos, it's quite bare-bones. The menu has a wide selection of various dumplings, buns, and appetizers. To order you write down your menu item number on a piece of paper and give to the waiters.   We ordered pork steamed dumplings, fried chicken dumplings, fried pork puns, and green onion pancakes. The dumplings were filled nicely with the meat and were quite large. For two people, we ordered more than enough and were very full. I loved the fried pork buns - they were juicy and fried just right at the bottom. I think the food is a little on the expensive side - it averages out to almost $1 per dumpling but for the quality and taste it's worth it.   Overall a great little family owned shop in Chinatown to get your fill of dumplings. It's generous on the fillings of the dumpling and very flavourful. Yummy indeed!",2
"This was the best food I've had in Toronto in my entire trip. I came where with my friends on a Friday afternoon and we had the whole place to ourselves for some time which felt pretty good.  We ordered several different types of dumplings, soup, pancake and soy milk, everything was YUM. In fact, we got so carried away by the wonderful items in the menu that we ordered more than we could eat.  It seemed like a family owned place and the staff treated us very well. Despite ordering an enormous amount of food, everything was served quickly and tasted good.  Reducing one star because at the end of a wonderful lunch, they refused to accept credit card even though there was a credit card sign outside. They said that their machine wasn't working but based on other reviews, it seems that they haven't been accepting credit card for a while. We were not from the country and had to go out looking for ATM to get cash. They did say they'll accept US dollar but without the exchange rate conversion which felt like a scam.  Everything else here was wonderful except for the last part about cash only payment.",2
"This food was so ""yummy"", pun intended. We ordered the shrimp dumplings (steamed) and were not expecting them to be so full of flavor. A tiny, clean, hidden gem- pushed back from the hustle and bustle of the main road. Would highly recommend!",2
"The service was great, but the quality of the food was pretty mediocre. Tried 4 different kinds of dumplings - neither of them were bad, but didn't stand out either.",1
"Got the chance to try out Zhang's Kitchen and it was pretty good! We went early in the afternoon so we were the only ones in the restaurant; however there were a couple of people doing take out.   The interior of the restaurant is very clean and simple and I was super impressed! The staff are friendly and attentive. I enjoyed how they served warm water infused with lemon - perfect on a cold winter day. We sat down and you order using the paper menu. We got the small braised beef brisket with noodle, the braised beef noodles (with soup) and the spicy sliced beef cold dish. You can customize your order and I added some quail eggs and bok choy and they don't skimp on the quantity!  The dishes arrived quickly and the portions were huge! There were large chunks of meat and the noodles were well cooked and flavourful. I particularly liked the spicy sliced beef. Overall, it was a very pleasant and filling meal and would swing by again if in the area.",2
"One cold winter afternoon... hungry... cold... wandering mindlessly downtown, I stumbled upon Zhang's Kitchen tucked in the southern side of Elm Street.   The restaurant itself is not big and I arrived late afternoon. An eerie quietness besets the restaurant. After settling down they started putting on some mandarin pop songs and handed over water and the paper menu.  Service was courteous and efficient.   Menu wise is extremely limited here, they specialize in yellow braised dishes.  I chose yellow braised chicken with thick noodles; a fine choice for a frigid day. The sauce that was reduced and used to braised the chicken was excellent. The simple flavours created by the cooking wine, ginger, scallion, leek, and other ingredients was delicious and would warm any stomach or heart.  The chicken was equally done well. The chicken was fall off the bones texture (even though their chicken was bone-less) without giving any feeling of it being overcooked.   What prompted a less than four star when everything sounded great? A few things... first the noodles lacked texture. They were pretty limp and felt like overcooked store bought versions. The mushroom that was added to the dish were the wet variety and the flavour of the mushroom failed to transfer to the sauce. They also added strings of green pepper on top of the dish for aesthetic purposes. This may be a personal thing but I hate when green peppers become fully cooked (while not having been grilled).   Overall score for Zhang's Kitchen is a solid 3.4. Unless they work on their noodles, you may want to stick with rice.",1
This place is amazing. I ordered the beef brisket noodle. The noodle had great texture and the brisket was super tender and soft. I got a small size and it was the right amount as i was pretty stuffed afterwards.  The server was very attentive and polite. They are also doing 10% off if you pay cash as part of their grand opening.  Its a very chill vibe inside. I'd definitely come back and would recommend others to try it.,2
"This Chinese restaurant focuses on Shangdong (in north eastern China) cuisine. It just opened on 2019-11-25. It is currently in soft opening So all food items are 10% off.  They are considered a fast food restaurant where you customize you own bowl with a protein (braised boneless chicken, braised pork rib, braised beef brisket), choose rice or noodles, choose the spiciness level, and then add-ons at $1.99 each.  All bone broths have no MSG and are made freshly each day. Some food may contain wheat, peanut and/or sesame.  There are also bowls of noodle dishes (4 options) and spiciness level.  There are also cold appetizer dishes and drinks including a delicious Chinese Herbal Tea.  The speed of preparation is good for students, takeout, or delivery.  The staff are all very courteous.   The restaurant interior is modern, bright and clean. There is free WiFi.",2
"I heard the buzz of this new joint and just had to check it out. I was darn skeptical... since it was completely empty at 6pm~ on a Saturday night.   But hey! It's their soft opening... so gave it a go and was pleasantly surprised with their delicious braised beef noodle. Very satisfying, came in a thick savory sauce (curry consistency) and juicy beef chunks.  The potatoes were a nice touch along with the noodles that just soaks up the sauce. In the end, my belly was super happy. More places need to do braised beef noodles like this! Next time I'll definitely come back and try their soup noodle, but with their stir fry saucy noodle stealing the show, hard to say the soup noodle would be as good.    We also ordered a side garlic broccoli and loved the tangy garlic sauce that it came with, so appetizing and just made me crave for it more. The sauce was probably some kind of Chinese vinegar, sugar and garlic concoction but when I tried doing it at home couldn't get it quite right.   Service was just alright gotta ask to get water-filled and decor is whatever - clean. Though they forgot we added extra bok choy in one order. Instead of just going in the kitchen and getting some bok choy on the side, they took the whole bowl of noodle and cooked and added it in... what a tease, especially when you're hungry and you want to eat and have to wait again. But hey I don't expect much from a casual Chinese restaurant.   Ps - they still offer 10% off with cash.",2
"New chinese restaurant near Ryerson, so if you're studying or working nearby and looking for some legit chinese food here's another option without having to make a journey to the west.  Nice interior. Brightly lit. Not accessible however: stairs to get up to the restaurant, and then stairs to get to washrooms on the second floor. They offer delivery however, so that can be a solution.  They specialize in braised meat with noodles or rice. Tried to get the braised beef but they were out for the night, so settled with braised pork ribs with noodles.  Portion size was pretty good. They offer small and large sizes, but I'm not sure how much smaller the small is. Decent amount of meat (like, a dozen pieces!)  An enjoyable meal. Check it out.",2
"Stopped by this place on a weeknight for a quick bowl of noodles and wasn't disappointed. The interior is simple and clean while service was average. This place specializes in braised meats (chicken, pork ribs, beef brisket) served over noodles or rice. Their braised chicken is comparable to Yang's braised chicken and was very tender. FYI their medium spice wasn't that spicy (and I'm normally a mild spice kind of girl). The portion sizes are fair (get a large if you're a meat eater) but it could be quite expensive if you want to add on veggies or other toppings. I don't really recommend the pork ribs because it was pretty dry and flavorless. The noodles and broth were delicious and reminded me of what I usually get at Hey Noodles.",2
Delicious braised beef brisket with rice (large).   Soaks up the sauce nicely.  4 different spice levels. I choose Mild.  $15.99 for a large.  Amazing lunch for a cold winter day.  Clean restaurant.,2
Decent noodles with lots of meat.  I definitely enjoyed the noodles so I'd say it's worth a try.,1
"Service is very good...friendly ambiance but I'm sorry, I just did not taste the authentic chinese food that I want.  Maybe they are just giving a modern twist but not for me.  Also, the meat are so thinly sliced for the price it should have more than that.  It just my taste and maybe some people will not agree.",1
"fried rice: it was really good and not too oily. It doesn't make you feel heavy at all. Not too salty and not too oily so you can keep eating without getting sick and tired of it.  Sweet and sour soup: the soup was good, since we ordered the noodle and rice, it was a good portion for the two of us  noodles: I don't quite remember how the noodles tasted sorry haha but I just remember everything being really good  servers are really nice :)",2
"Great place for affordable comfort Chinese food! Might get a bit packed though.  We've ordered green beans, noodles, and a bunch of stuff (I don't remember quite frankly) but the food was quick, fresh, and hot!   Will definitely  come back :)",2
"Summary: clean, classy, classic vibe restaurant serves tasty Chinese food!   It was pretty quiet on a Thursday at 12:30 pm. I was content seeing the minimalist look and classic blue white dishware - it honestly reminded me of my childhood.  The lady at the counter recommended the General Tao chicken but I was on a budget and the chicken didn't come with rice (rice is $2 a bowl)... Plus I had my heart set on getting the green onion pancake as an appetizer, so I went with that plus the braised beef noodles.  The green onion pancakes came first and were quite good. They split into an outer and inner rim. The outer rim has plentiful green onions... Tasty!  The braised beef noodles came after - medium mild width was perfect for me (I'm very particular about the size of my noodles), there was a solid amount of meat and it was mostly tender, and the noodles were perfectly al dente! In addition to chunks of meat there is also a bit of shredded pieces of the beef as you dive into the meal... Delicious!  The meal comes with a white rabbit candy after.  Solid experience!",2
We ordered through Uber eats. The driver was quick and really friendly. The food was hot and not too expensive. Otherwise the food was not our favorite. Out of everything we enjoyed the spring rolls the best. The rest of the food was pretty bland and not a lot of flavor. It was fulfilling and we were hungry so it wasn't the worst thing.,0
"I've had my eye on this place for a while and it definitely met my expectations. It's a cute little family-owned restaurant. It had giant windows and clean decor. It was surprisingly empty on a Saturday afternoon. The servers were very friendly and attentive.   I loved that the menu was simple and straightforward, so we weren't overwhelmed by too many choices. We ordered the braised beef noodles ($12 - they've raised the price from previously posted menus). We also got an order of pan fried dumplings to share ($9). We were really happy with everything we ordered.   The prices are a little steeper than what you'd find in Chinatown, but their noodle portions were quite large and they gave an ample amount of beef. The restaurant was also much cleaner than the ones in Chinatown.   I'd definitely make the trip back to try their other dishes!",2
"This is probably one of my favourite Chinese restaurants in the area! It's a cute little place that serves pretty good portions of delicious dishes at an okay price (slightly more expensive but worth it). My go-to dishes are always the Shanghai noodles and the green beans, which are both SO GOOD. Also, the dishes here aren't greasy but still taste amazing!   Unfortunately, they don't have A/C so it is slightly hot especially during the scorching summer days, but honestly we were too busy studying our mouths with noodles to complain.   If you're in the area, give Chop Chop a try and I guarantee that soon you'll find yourself craving it and coming in regularly.",2
"Let me first say that I was walking into this restaurant expecting to give this place a 4-star (if not 5-star review). I was skeptical of the reviews that rated this place under 4-stars because of raving reviews from co-workers of mine. However, that co-worker went to this place the Friday before I came and also deemed the quality has declined. So maybe it is worthwhile reading on my review as to why that's the case.  My friend and I ordered three things so i'll describe each item below- starting with the best.  1. Green beans- if all the other food was as good as this one, I would've given this place a 4-star review. Fresh, flavorful, and on-point. The wringly green beans stir-fried into the peppers and mushrooms were fantastic. However, this was a very small plate for it to cost $11. Quality: 4.5/5. Price for the food amount: 3/5.  2. Fried rice- this was their featured fried rice and a recommendation from the co-worker. I'm not a fried rice person to begin with but chose this because of the rec. This was just fried rice I could get at any chinese restaurant in chinatown for probably 75% of this cost. It was a lot but not memorable. Quality: 3.5/5. Price for the food amount: 4/5   3. Boiled pork and chive dumplings- having chosen the healthier version of the dumpling options (versus fried), these turned out to be the most disappointing meal here. The dough/skin of the dumpling was very thick (and this is my greatest fear). The ratio of meat to skin was probably 1:2.5. Quality: 2/5. Price for the food amount: 3/5. You can get the same dumplings but WAYYYYYY better at dumpling house in Chinatown. Thank me later and go there.  So in conclusion, if you're looking for the hype of this place that came from BlogTO or other reviewers, this place will not meet your standards. I would go elsewhere for chinese food- specifically Chinatown; unless you want the aesthetics and hip vibe, then this place got that nailed down.",1
"Update: I came back to try the General Tsao chicken and the vermicelli noodles as promised.   The chicken was AMAZING - it was crispy but not over fried, and there was just the right amount of sauce. I would definitely reorder this!  The vermicelli portion size was huge, we ended up taking most of it home. It was also pretty good! The shrimp wontons were crispy and great as well.   I love the atmosphere of this place, the high ceilings and ceiling windows make this place look bright and modern. They also have a patio! I will keep coming back here for sure.",2
"As a Taiwanese person, I have to say, this place is by no means authentic. However, there's nothing wrong with that.   I ordered the Taiwanese beef noodles. The soup base and the noodles were a lot lighter than the traditional Taiwanese noodles. I was unsure how to feel about that at first, but I realize that this could be an introduction to Taiwanese food for people who aren't use to the strong flavors that Asian foods sometimes have. This, in combination with the decor and presentation of the place, is a good way of promoting Taiwanese dishes and introduce non-Taiwanese people to Taiwanese dishes. Despite it not being so authentic.",2
"I enjoyed a solo dinner here recently. The room is is tiny, but I grabbed a window seat. I had three dishes. The pan-fried dumplings were very good; fresh and expertly fried and lots of flavour, albeit very similar to what you can find elsewhere in Chinatown (see Mother's Dumplings and the Dumpling House for example). The green beans were truly outstanding; perfectly cooked and seasoned, and not too greasy. I could eat a plate of those beans for lunch every single day.  The only (small) misstep was the Taiwanese basil chicken. While hot and fresh, it was a little dry and didn't have much basil flavour.  I would definitely return.",2
Best Chinese restaurant in Toronto! The General Tso is the best we've had in Toronto! There isn't a thing on the menu that I wouldn't recommend!,2
"Came for lunch around 12:30 on a Wednesday. It is a fairly small spot but it wasn't that busy. The service was very prompt and food came out fast so turn around is quick. Loved the ordering sheet. The menu had something for everyone and it all sounded very good. We settled on the shanghai noodles, scallion pancake, deep fried shrimp wontons, spring rolls, pan fried pork and veg dumplings. Bill was around $50 and it was a lot of food for 2 people. Would return to try more items.",2
"Family owned restaurant. The outside wall paint of ""chop chop"" stands out from afar and reminded me that blogto did a review of the store awhile back! Very friendly and kind staff! Love how there's patio and inside option depending on weather. Must gets : friend onion pancake, their dumplings. I would also probably recommend getting a plate of greens as a lot of their items are fried. Super cool chill place w/ pretty authentic Asian food!",2
"I give this place 3.5 stars.  This little neighbourhood hole-in-the-wall is one major black west of Chinatown proper. I like the industrial minimalist decor and the open-concept kitchen - which means you can hear the comforting sounds of food being prepared and cooked.  The menu is simple - not the 10-page ones you get at the authentic Chinese restaurants like Asian Legend. It seems they've decided just to focus on the crowd-pleaser items.  We ordered the chilli fish and the beef noodle soup. Both dishes came to the table piping hot. The chilli fish is a medium-sized plate of lightly battered, small fish fillets with a nice kick - I give it 4 stars. The beef noodle soup is a big bowl filled with (mostly) tender pieces beef, thick spaghetti-like noodles, what looked like bak choy and broth that also has a kick - I give it 3.5 stars.  The young wait staff seem eager - which is good. (Perhaps some of the more authentic Chinese restaurants like Kwan - at Yonge-St. Clair -  should have some of their waiters get pointers from Chop Chop.)  I would go back for the chilli fish.",1
"Chop Chop is a hidden gem Taiwanese restaurant that I have recently discovered! I fell in love with their authentic ginger been and braise beef noodles; both dishes instantly shipped me back to Taiwan the moment I put it in my mouth. That nostalgia flavour you simply couldn't find it anywhere else in this city! Another recommendation is the spicy papaya salad; it is refreshing and herby taste, it is an excellent appetizer!",2
"Since I've reviewed this so many times, I figured I'd reiterate my moms first impressions this time.   Green onion pancake was impressive.  The baby bok choy wasn't up the par, as it was a bit old.  The braised beef noodle soup was ok. The soup wasn't strong enough - wasn't Braised long enough.  Salt and pepper shrimp was ok. It was an old style way of cooking where the shell is still attached.  Chilli fish was very good for its price and the portion was plentiful.  Pan fried dumpling's skin was too fragile. It broke upon the touch of the chopstick.  Basil chicken wasn't special. It reminded us of Go4Tea.   Overall she gives this place a 3+, so I rounded it to a 4!",2
"We ordered and ate way too much at this place! We especially enjoyed General Tao's chicken and the braised short ribs. The dumplings, fried tofu and spring rolls were fine - not spectacular but tasty. The place was cute and our service was excellent. The food came out steaming hot!",2
"Well, it's been a while since I've reviewed CC and now we are not only regulars, my husband considers it his fave restaurant in the city. Service is always great, their patio rocks, and we never eat anything that isn't delicious (and they change the menu enough you can always try something new). We always get a noodle dish, but we were super impressed by the eggplant and beef today ... mmm and those green beans ... and the fried tofu ... aaaaaa. They really shaped up and found themselves. We love you!! Stop selling out of the pork belly stir fry!!",2
"A solid 4 stars.  General Tao Chicken ($14) and the Green Beans ($11) stole the show. Legit, these might be the best green beans I've ever had and the portion is a good size for those concerned about $11 vegetables.   The Green Onion Pancake ($6) was pretty tasty, and the Basil Fried Chicken was pretty good as well although a little dry.  Admittedly the fried pork dumplings ($9) were a little too soggy, but when I brought the leftovers home and gave them an extra bit of pan frying for crispier edges was quite good.  Despite being a small place that was busy, I will say I was very impressed with how quickly they get all the food out to you.  Overall, glad I finally got to try this place out!",2
"What I got: Eggplant with beef ($14), Chili fish ($15), Pan fried pork and chive dumplings ($9), Green Onion pancake ($5), Ginger Beef ($13), Fried Vermicelli ($13)  Pros: - Great restaurant to check out if you want greasy hangover food without it being the boring burger and fries that you see at the nearby patios.  - All the items on the menu are under $15 and all dumplings are under $10, if you go with a big group, you can try several items for cheap.  - My favourite items are the Chili fish and eggplant, they were very flavourful, not too spicy and goes great with rice. Other popular items people got were the sweet and sour pork and fries green beans.  - They have a great patio however the wait time can be quite long and there is not as much seating inside. We went as a group of 7 and they were nice enough to accommodate even without a reservation  - Good selection of vegetarian food.  - They give white rabbit candy at the end when you pay the bill.  - I also saw that they do delivery and it seems quite popular as foodora bikers were coming in and out frequently.   Cons: - Compared to the classic Chinese restaurants in Chinatown, the portions are smaller for almost the same price. However I would say this place is probably cleaner and has a more hip vibe.  - One star taken off only because the scallion pancake was quite burnt, when we ordered a second, it came out golden with a soft center and crunchy exterior like it should be so it was probably just a one-time issue.",2
"Totally in love with this place. I always come and order hot pot for my meal and feel really full whenever I finish.  I would recommend try hot pot with noodles.  When you become a regularly customers, the manager will give u the soy milk for freee. Lol that's what I love from this store. I love the way the manager treat his customers. They're so nice",2
"I simply can not rave enough about this place!! Very good price for the amount and quality of food! This is another place that serves crossing the bridge noodles (a boiling hot broth with toppings on the side that you add into the soup to cook/warm up) with unlimited noodle refills.  They have a wide variety of soup bases ranging from original to pickled cabbage to tomato to spicy ones. My personal favourites are the thai curry (not too spicy) and tomato. They are always adding new flavours such as the recent tom yum. Each soup comes with a bowl of rice noodles and 10 toppings with meat. Sometimes the toppings are on rotation but you usually get: a quail egg, corn, black fungas, fish tofu, shrimp, squid/ham/sausage slices, corn, and tofu skin. It is recommended to put in the meat first into the soup to cook it. Most of the toppings are cooked already so it is just reheated in the soup.   NOTE: When you receive your plate of toppings, you can ask to switch out a few for other ones instead!    TIP: If you go before 5pm, they have a 'lunch' special where you get a soup combo with an appetizer and a pop for $10.99!! Previously their combo was a cold appetizer instead of their hot ones.  Side Dishes: For their hot ones, the deep fried cuttlefish balls are my absolute favourite. They come in an amazing sauce as well. The takoyaki is not bad but a little bit too doughy for my taste. I tried the fried tofu but its a bit soggy and too saucy. For their cold ones, I like the garlic cucumber or the duck tongue with seaweed salad.   Service: Fast and attentive. They would usually remind you to order quickly as well especially if you are borderline near the cut off time for the lunch special.   Overall, YES. Come here and get your noodle fix!",2
"So good and perfect for our last meal in TO! 2 pickled cabbage, 2 original and one chicken ginger with a side of lobster balls.  Each soup came with 10 add-ins except chicken ginger which had its own chicken pieces and goodies. Very reasonable for so much food - free rice noodle refill !  Service was fast and friendly and filled up quickly. We will be back",2
Nothing bad to say about this place! The price was amazing for the amount of food you get. We got the larger portioned meals that come on a burner with extra sides and dipping sauce for $12-13 which was only $1-2 more than the reg portion (price difference for different broths). My boyfriend got the original and I had the tomato broth. Both were delicious! The service was great as well. They offered to refill our broths half way through our meal and always refilled our water without being asked. Definitely coming back! We also received 10% off our bill for checking in on yelp.,2
"Huge portion soup with free refills! I did not expect so much food for $10. The thai curry flavour soup was very good. I threw in all the toppings without thinking and it turned out great, nothing went overboard. Will definitely come back to try the other soups.",2
"Place: This place is so my favorite! I cannot stress how this is probably a top thing to do in Toronto.   Service: The service is pretty good. They are good at providing the necessary things needed for your entrees or what you ordered.  Food/price: The food is known for their hotpot and ""DIY broths"". It is worth your buck because it is really fun making your own soup. There are some dishes where the noodles are all you can eat. SO WORTH  Audience: A lot of my friends said that they really love going here when they travel to Toronto. Good for friends or dates!   Recommend/tips? I highly recommend this place and the tip would be come when it is not that busy! So not the typical lunch/dinner times.",2
"Fudao is a standard noodle house that gives really generous portions!   I was actually expecting it to be more of a dipping noodle situation after seeing the photos but it's actually more of a hot pot since you're supposed to toss in all of the toppings and noodles in your broth immediately before it cools.   For the price, I think it's a solid spot that will definitely fill you up. The service was just OK. I was surprised that there was a decent amount of seating. If you're visiting, it's not a must but if you're looking for a place to get a substantial amount of food for a good price it's worth trying.",1
"MUST TRY: Original noodle soup Spicy noodle soup Chicken in chili sauce (side dish)  Recommended: Takoyaki Cuttlefish balls Crispy tofu  Too spicy for me:  Spicy Pickled Pepper Soup  It's a terrific price point. Excellent cheap eats Obviously, winter is the best time to eat here.   STORY TIME:  [A little boy sucking on a post-dinner restaurant lollipop walked in front of our table. He stared at us. My dinner companion engages...]  DC: Hi, can I help you? Boy: Can you speak chinese? DC: No. Boy: I can speak Chinese. DC: Ok.. Boy: I was born in China. DC: Oh...how old are you? Boy: 8. DC: What are you carrying? Boy: I'll show you....  [Boy spends 2 full minutes trying to unzip his bag. Then, he pops out a full tuxedo with a little bowtie.]  Boy: I have a performance tomorrow  Me: Do you play the piano?  Boy: HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT??!!!!!!!!   [His sister walks up. Doublefisting lollipops.]  Sister: hELLOOOOO!!  [Mother grabs the girls hand, gives the boy the death stare, and they leave.]  This did not seem out of place with the casual nature of the restaurant.  Based on a sample of ~5 meals",2
"If you dine at Fudao, you should expect a very generous portion of food (due to their unlimited noodle refill) for an extremely reasonable price. However, what stops me from giving this place a higher rating is that I didn't find myself wanting more throughout the meal.   I tried the Fudao rice noodle and thai curry and Teppan grill squid skewer. I expected the squid to have a nice grilled/smoky taste but when it came to the table, it appeared to have just been boiled(?) and dipped in sauce. The rice noodle dish presentation is pleasant at first, but then you have to dump all the sides immediately into the boiling pot in order to have everything cooked properly. Once this is done, it becomes just like any other noodle dish. The meat was actually surprisingly soft/tender but only 3 pieces will come with the meal.  Regardless, Fudao does seem to be a popular restaurant in Toronto and was packed when I came, so perhaps it's worth a visit. Personally though, if I was back in town, I wouldn't go out of my way for it unless I just wanted to get full for a cheap price.",1
"I think I ordered the wrong broth here. I probably would have enjoyed my meal much more but the broth was overpowering, a lot more pungent than I'm used to. But I powered through it and it ended up being good. So point is, don't get the pickled vegetable with pork broth unless you know what you're getting into! I wish I could come here to try more soups. I love the concept: Piping hot soup still boiling as you dip the veggie and other condiments in. Add a few slices of pork and then the noodles as your last bet. Very presentable and affordable!",1
"Excellent find on our 1st day arrival of Toronto. We walked through China town and found this one, lots of people in there, must be popular. Ordered noodle soup for myself and husband ordered rice dish. We also ordered some side dish, like squid, spicy glass noodle and duck tongue. Soup is delicious! And authentic! Just like i remembered in Yun Nan of China!  When we check out, they don't accept US credit card, US debit card, only cash in Canadian dollar which we don't have! But they accept weechat pay from China! Unbelievable! Guess it's China town.. the service is great!",2
"The food is good here, I love the thai coconut curry broth they have. It is pretty filling considering they have unlimited noodles to order. Its your typical noodle place. Not a fan of how one of the waitors instructs us how to eat and what side to place our bowls etc., ESPECIALLY when at one point we went almost every day to every other day.. like how do you now recognize us? lol anyways other than that its good.",2
"Came in around 8 PM and it was still quite busy, though the restaurant isn't that big maybe 30-40 seats.  Service is pretty good you can see a waitress going around from time to time checking up on water refills.  This restaurant specializes in crossing bridge rice noodle soup, which you might have seen with the platter of a ingredients beside a stone bowl of hot broth and a bowl of rice noodles on the side. They have a dozen different soup bases for you to choose from whether you like it spicy, sour, or something light.  I ordered the new kimchi soup. It arrived in about 10 minutes, but it was hot and visibly boiling in the bowl. Had a nice flavor; not too salty not too spicy. The soup was quite light in texture, not too much grease, and easy to go down. There's enough soup for two or three refills of noodles if you have a larger appetite.  The ingredients provided include a piece of shrimp, mushrooms, chinese sausage, ground meat, sliced meat, and tofu, which is a pretty nice mix.  According to the menu they have a daily afternoon special between 2 and 5 where you can get any noodle, a cold dish, and a soft drink for only $10.99 which is pretty nice if you're having a late lunch, or an early dinner.",2
"I am a soup fanatic. I have soup summer winter fall, no matter the season.   This noodle place fulfills all my criteria: clean, CHEAP, beautiful gorgeous food (I love it when they set down the huge stone pot of soup in front of you), wonderful selection of soup base (I go for the original in the summer, and spicy during winter), they even give you SHRIMP as one of the side dishes, PHEW! LUX!   Free noodle refill  Awesome service  Discount when you pay with cash  Close to campus  (Almost) no wait time.  I'm just waiting for them to get $$$ so they can expand to a bigger venue (and possibly franchise it so I can have my soup closer to home..)",2
"Decent priced, tasty noodles Was a little confused on how to order. So we ordered extra meat, which was not necessary because the noodle combos already came with meat.",2
"What I got: Original Rice Noodle ($8.49) and Pickled Cabbage Soup ($9.99)  Pros: - Came here on a very rainy day and was able to get seats despite this place being pretty busy on a weeknight.  - The soups here are supposedly made with no MSG, so you won't have to feel guilty about drinking it. - Lunch menu is quite worth it, for ~$10 you can get soup noodles, with appetizer and drink.  - Free refills on the noodles but not on the seafood/meat/veg you put in the soup.  - Overall a great place for cheap eats with a nice selection of little items you can put into the soup. - I'd recommend you to put everything in while the soup was still boiling to avoid eating raw seafood.  Cons: - Take debit and cash only - The seating arrangement can be a bit tight so you can hear the conversation of the people next to you. - The Pickled Cabbage soup was on the saltier side, so I would recommend the thai or original one more.",2
"I love going to Fudao Noodle House to get my fix for Crossing the Bridge noodles. They have a good variety of broths that you can choose from and they range in spice level. My favourite broths are the Thai Curry and the Spicy and Sour.   For those of you who aren't familiar with Crossing the Bridge noodles, you get the broth in this burning hot stone pot separate from 10 different toppings and the noodles which are unlimited refills, and c'mon, who can say no to that? You put the rolls of meat they give you or you can order extra toppings into your broth like slices of pork, lamb or beef, or even beef/fish balls. Then you put the rest of the toppings in there, the noodles and voila!   I haven't come by in a while and I came when it was relatively steady but the service was still on point. They've refilled my water and asked if everything was okay ever so often. I also have a shellfish sensitivity so I don't add the shrimp they provide as an extra topping, but when I went on my last visit, they offered to swap it for another ingredient I could eat. It was great customer service and something I don't really see other places that offer Crossing the Bridge noodles doing.   Overall, really great service and yummy food that is decently priced!",2
"As an avid fan of Dagu, I must say that Fudao is a veryyy close second (I'll explain why later). Their prices are on average $2 ish cheaper than Dagu and the concept is similar with a few differences in the toppings. I got their picked cabbage soup and man was it good. The soup came out bowling hot and it was hard to not want to drink it in a rush because the flavor was ON POINT. The reason why rated this second to Dagu is because the rice noodles are thinner and I prefer thicker noodles. All in all, 5/5 for value and variety.",2
"Fixed my noodle craving here and it's unlimited noodles too.  I usually get their Picked Cabbage soup because it's simple and not too heavy. On the side, get the spicy cold noodles. They're AMAZING",2
"Cute concept, but the toppings are absolutely horrible! The price is very very low, but I found myself paying less for great food in Chinatown so the low price does not play any factor here.  The toppings to be put into the broth are of the lowest quality. The meat is severely freezer burned and sort of breaks apart in the broth once cooked. Their sausage also tastes like couch medicine in liquid form.. why? Fudao seemed like the perfect place on a freezing Toronto night for me to warm up, but I regretted my decision more and more with each bite that I took.",0
"BOTTOM LINE: Just as a good as the uptown one but smack in the middle of China Town. Also, is still applies that getting the membership is totally worth it even if you only eat here once a year.   (This is a pre-COVID19 review)  Please see my review of their original location here: https://www.yelp.ca/biz/xin-jiang-restaurant-markham-2?hrid=haS7u6E9o9XlJcs228UvEg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)  Their menus are the same but this location is a bit more cramped/cozier than the uptown one, and less upscale in its decor (e.g., your tea is served in the staple steel teapots instead of the nice ones with flowing spouts).   Their specialty is lamb given it is Northwestern Chinese cuisine, and to that end, I cannot recommend enough their LAMB SKEWERS. I also tried this other cold lamb appetizer (I forgot the name) that was less memorable because the flavours seemed all jumbled up with the other ingredients. Regrettably, in most of their other dishes without lamb, or the dishes that can be considered standard Chinese dishes (e.g., stir fried veggies), I found them quite 'meh', and would recommend you stick with their regional dishes instead.",2
"I came here with a group of friends and I have to say I wasn't very impressed.  It took us a long time to even get enough menus that we could share. The menus are confusing as there is a large place-mat like sheet you can use, or the menu book with pictures.  Then they tried to sell us a membership. Really? A membership? When I looked at the menu again there are 2 different prices. The cheaper one is the membership price and is of course brighter and more prominent than the higher non-member price.   We ordered a variety of items and they were all meh. A few items we had to ask for again as they were forgotten.   The staff run around yelling at each other and its really annoying and disturbing.   When we finished and tried to pay, the waiter tried to split our bill and half way through asking each of us what we ordered he gave up and gave it to another server, so we had to start over again.  I wouldn't go again unless I went with someone with one of these fancy memberships.",0
"They have a few locations across the city, and I would say the quality is consistent.   The 3 must-get items:  1. Garlic shoot rice with lamb (comes in a bamboo pot) 2. Lamb or chicken noodles (stir-fried) 3. Sizzling eggplant with chicken",2
"This place is not as good as expected because of the following reasons:  1. Shredded lamb with pancakes were dry and not fresh and portions for the lamb skewers were extremely small compared to some other tables. They should have equal portion sizes for all customers.  2. The Western Chinese lamb rice is a strange combination of what seemed like sweet potato and the rice was clumped together. It did not taste good.  3. The membership system is ridiculous as the normal prices have a huge difference for each item listed on the menu. They should provide members to have a discount over the total bill instead.  4. My friend had food poisoning shortly after leaving the restaurant.  For these reasons, I would be reluctant to come back as there are many places that offer much better quality and portions.",0
"Yes, I just ate at the same restaurant two nights in a row... but I went to a different location!    We ordered a cold noodle salad which was sold out at the Dundas location.  Spicy, cool, crunchy, chewy,...  I crave this dish especially in the summer.    We had a mixed plate of spicy (mouth numbing) beef, tripe, etc... so delicious.  One of my favourite dishes!  The handmade noodles.  I can eat a plate of these noodles with anything on the menu.  It went really well with the sauces from my aforementioned dishes.  The lamb skewer was seasoned nicely with cumin and whatever else they use.   The meat was tender with just a bit of fat.  We didn't mind it at all.  We over ordered with one additional dish.  We had a braised lamb dish served on naan.  I found the bread too heavy and would've preferred it to be served separately.    I'll admit, I'm still not a fan of the VIP card concept.  You do save on every single dish whether it be $1 or $4.  I do believe the downtown locations are much better than the uptown location at Metro Square.  Now that I know I will come back, we had to purchase one.  It's good at all locations and for 2 years.    Oh right, the service here was amazing!  The two servers spoke English, were helpful, and were so efficient!  They were friendly too!  Five stars for them!",2
"I LOVEEEEEE THIS PLACE! This is by far my favourite Chinese restaurant in downtown Toronto. It's hard to find decent Chinese food outside of Markham but this place does it for me. Definitely get one of the soups (they are all very comforting) the fried rice is to die for (and I don't even like fried rice in general), the cold dish smashed cucumbers are just like my mom makes them. I've tried so many dishes here in my past few visits and not a single one of them has been a disappointment. I recommend this place 1 million times over, just make sure that you make reservations or you use yelp to hold your spot in line because there are often long wait times.",2
"Best new Chinese place on Spadina. Western Chinese (I.e., Uyghur/halal), quite different from other Chinese restaurants in the area and very delicious. Lunch specials feature unbelievable value and variety. Clientele mostly Chinese. Service is fast and efficient. You would be crazy not to eat here.",2
the owner guys is good n careful for us not to think anything while eating. the restraints atmosphere also good n comfy,2
"All good, we have a friend who only eats halah and it's hard to find a restaurant for all of us with different dietary requirements. Glad to find this one!",2
Totally delicious (and fast!). We live in Chinatown and go out a lot and this is our new favourite spot.,2
"Very bad service the servers are so loud and rude .. the food tastes bad and super oily, the chicken is not white meat while they told me it was , the rice had rocks in it that almost broke my tooth and so not clean the whole experience was so bad I wouldn't recommend anyone to go there and on top of that I went back home with food poison and had diarreah .. the worst place ever please watch out",0
"I stumbled upon this restaurant during my first visit to Toronto. I always make an effort to go there every time I visit because it's that good!  First off, don't be alarmed by the man in the back who looks like he's abusing the noodles. Everything comes hand-pulled and fresh! I love the thick cut noodles with chicken. Prices are great and portions are huge. What else can you ask for?!",2
"Amazing prices, huge portions and everything was delicious. I come here a couple times a week and have always had a great experience.  I love their cold side dishes like chily beef tendon, shredded potato salad and tofu salad, it's a great paring with the noodle soups",2
"Great beef noodle soup place! The place doesn't look like much, to be honest, but their food is quite delicious.  As with many Asian restaurants, they're very hands-off with their service. Only there to take your order, give you food, and refill water. Personally I prefer service like this, because they aren't asking you questions about food that you don't know how to answer, or will inevitably just default to ""good"" because you can't think of anything else and are trying to be Canadian-polite.   Their food is all quite reasonably priced and with many noodle options--both with and without soups. Their noodles are hand-pulled and are wonderfully elastic and chewy! Their broth is also pretty nice, not overly salty, but a great base for chili oil. That being said, it's not particularly unique compared to a lot of beef noodle soup places in the GTA, but it's still a wonderful addition.  Come by if you want a nice comforting warm bowl of food!",2
"Dined in here for early lunch on Sunday with a party of 5.  There were plenty of seats available.  It looks like the place was getting busier with people coming in.   Tried the beef skewer (2skewers for $3.49) and it was nicely seasoned.  It was very chewy with fat in it.  The dumpling (4pcs for $2.99) was crispy and delicious.   The hand pulled ramen with braised soup ($9.49) was pretty good.  I would have enjoyed it more if it was spicy.  I added the chilli sauce they provided on the side and it made a big difference-giving the broth more flavour.  They were pretty generous on the amount of braised beef given.  I opted for the wide big noodle and it reminded me lasagna noodles lol.  It was nice of them to provide me with scissors to cut my noodles or else it would have been hard to eat   I tried my brother's hot spicy noodles sichuan style ($9.99) and I enjoyed it. This was a dry noodle mixed with bean sprouts, green onions, cucumber and ground pork.  He opted for regular noodles.  I really enjoyed the spice in it.    Overall, the size of their noodle dishes were huge.  Struggled to finish my noodles even though it was my first meal of the day.",2
"One thing I noticed in Toronto is that there are many homemade noodle shop, and there is one on Spadina Avenue that I enjoyed a lot. Homemade Ramen (中國蘭州牛肉拉面) sells authentic lan zhou ramen (蘭州拉面). Once you enter the shop, you can see a chef at the back pulling noodles non-stop. They make the noodles fresh to order, and they have 6 different noodles to choose from. Each has a different thickness and width.   We ordered two items to share, and of course, we have to order a bowl of Hand-Pulled Noodle with Beef, as well as Shredded Pig's Ear with Chili.  For the Hand-Pulled Noodle with Beef, the default noodles are regular, which are 2.5mm wide. However, I decided to change to leek leaves, which are 5mm flat noodles. Once our order was in, the chef started to pull noodles, though I wasn't sure if he is making our orders. Within 10 minutes, our noodles arrived. The broth is clear and light, with few beef slices and pickled radish. The portion is huge, so it is perfect to share. The noodles are perfectly cooked, nice and chewy. I love the broth so much, and I am surprised by the addition of pickled radish in the soup - the combination goes super well together.   The Shredded Pig's Ear with Chili came as well. It looks spicy, but it is not. It is on a sweeter side, with the addition of bell peppers. I prefer having just the shredded pig's ear with minced garlic and chili oil on its own. The bell peppers are not necessary here.   *** Overall Impression ***  Homemade Ramen is another gem on Spadina Avenue. It has good service, clean ambiance, and most importantly, inexpensive noodles. You can get a bowl of noodles for less than $10 here, and I can guarantee that you will leave with a full stomach!  Although I didn't try much here, I will definitely revisit and try other noodle bowls! My recommended item here is the Hand-Pulled Noodle with Beef, and I think the leek leaves' width and thickness are perfect.   Taste : 4.5/5 * Service: 4/5 * Ambiance: 4.5/5 * Quality-Price: 5/5",2
"Having recently gone to GB and not feeling fulfilled, I can safely say Homemade satisfied my hand-pulled noodle soup craving.   Located in the heart of Chinatown, Homemade is now one of my favourite restaurants as (1) I'm a huge soup noodle fan, and (2) they have a larger selection of soup noodles vs. their competitors. I found the noodles themselves to be far superior than the other places as the chefs here understand that it is not just about the novelty of pulling noodles but also how to cook them - to just the right texture (expect a little chewiness similar to al dente). The other places make a big show from the making of the noodles but then end up overcooking them so that become too starchy or soft, Homemade gets it just right.  We also ordered the lamb skewers which were delicious and a must-try. Servings were also generous. Homemade ramen should be at the top of the list when considering which restaurants to eat at in Chinatown.",2
"Was absolutely starving after a morning at the museum and then decided to go to Homemade Ramen. I asked for a table of one for lunch and was immediately seated. They have a menu and a notepad you can write on for what you want (which is kinda interesting). Then give the notepad to the waiter/waitresses and wait for your food!  Sliced noodle stir-fry with lamb ($11.99) - I loved the sliced noodles; unfortunately for me, it wasn't uber uber thick. However I did love the noodle flavor and there was a lot of stuff on the plate for the price that I paid. They have a good amount of meat in there and I was absolutely enthralled of that fact. There were some vegetables in there that I didn't really like, but you know, to each their own haha. I loved having it stir fried and I loved the flavor that came out of it. It's good and aplenty.  Also went for the scallion pancake which I enjoyed; it was cut in 5 pieces. It's a bit of a crisp but not too much scallion flavor really in there, but I do love the flour flavor in there.  Food comes out at a good pace; service is decent - flag em down haha. I do wish I knew what the option for thick noodles are, but not noodle soup hahahahaha.",2
"I was craving some warm noodles when I stumble across this restaurant. Upon looking at the menu, I realize there were many options to choose from! I got the slice noodle with braised beef and the portion size was really big.   I found the noodles and soup to be a bit on the bland side but it was still delicious.   I also got their lamb kebob and their green onion pancake and it was warm and really good as well!  The service here was quick and servers were all very nice. It's definitely a place I would come back to again.",2
"This place is awesome. I love their pork belly. It was nice to add cucumber to the dish, so refreshing. I also got their noodles dish as well. I ordered big wide noodles and regretted later. I didn't expect the noodles to be that wide. I was struggling the whole time eating the noodles but the broth was amazing. I would highly recommended visiting this place if you ever in Chinatown.",2
"Fresh ramen noodles are not the healthiest food you can eat, but do taste so good.  I picked a dish with braised beef.  The noodles were extremely enjoyable. The braised beef was not tender.  Next time I will pick another meat with extra noodles!  Service was prompt & efficient. Decor is very basic.",1
"One of our go-to spots!   For price, flavour and quantity of food - you can't go wrong.   My favourite things in this place are the skewers. Just drooling while writing this haha. The lamb, beef and chicken options are heavennn! So much flavour.   Always need veggies with my meals, so we order Chinese broccoli with garlic. I don't know what they do to the meal. Super simple but it's so crunchy and tasty.  Lastly, hand pulled noodles are a must. I usually go for the braised beef but this time around we got the sliced beef. I prefer braised! You get a good mix of fat to meat ratio.  Highly recommend this place. Just don't be high maintenance!",2
Came here for dinner and I never knew this place existed in Chinatown.  I definitely enjoyed their homage ramen.  The noodles are soft and chewy and the portions are big too.  Prices are reasonable as well.,2
"This ramen place is always reliable when you're in the area and want a warm bowl of noodles. Service is quick, prices are reasonable, and there's a bit more protein in it than your usual ramen places. The noodles are fresh but sometimes more chewy than other times. There is a lot of noodle so it is filling for sure.",2
"Usually spend no more than $30 for dinner for two here. Very affordable and delicious. All noodles are made fresh in-house. Items to get on menu are: saliva chicken, stir fried noodles, dry chicken noodle with a chili, and some lamb skewers. It's been renovated not too long ago, place is bright and clean. Service is consistently good for a Chinese restaurant.",2
"Tip: Don't forget to designate what size of noodles you want; I forgot as the menu doesn't show the options but the restaurant wall does.  Solo traveler here. Spending a few days in Toronto and me not being used to the cold (Cali girl here), I was really craving for some hot soup. Saw some good reviews and liked the hand-pulled noodle aspect to the restaurant, so wanted to check this place out.  The waitresses were very friendly. They give you receipt paper where you write down your order and they take it to the kitchen. I ordered the braised beef noodle soup as well as the beef sesame pancake. Pretty cool that near the cash register you can see someone hand pulling the noodles.   Food came out at a reasonable time. The beef was kinda cold and a little dry, wasn't living for it. The noodles were alright; I forgot to indicate what size noodles I wanted as the sizes are only mentioned on the wall, not in the actual menu. Soup was a bit salty, added some chili oil and it mellowed it down a bit. As for the beef sesame pancake, I should've looked more closely to the Yelp pics because it was smaller than I expected it to be lol. 4 small pieces for 6 bucks.....more than a buck a piece lol. Though pre-judgment aside, the pieces were actually pretty tasty lol I'd actually eat it as a snack.  Would I want to come back here again? Hmm, maybe to try out the other soups in the menu and ask for larger noodles.",2
"Pros: quick service, nice staff, great (fresh) ramen noodles  Cons: dirty table, staff overworked, hard to get a table after lunch still, difficulty finding the best vegetarian/chicken options, some waiters can't communicate in English that well though are super nice and try hard   Summary: I ordered chicken despite wanting vegetarian but am new to eating more veggie options so I tried to just get the Chicken stir fry. It was all chicken, too much salt and barely any veggies. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again but I'd be open to getting a ramen dish. My mom got beef so I couldn't really try it, I only tried the noodles. She loved her beef ramen so maybe that helps someone out there",1
Best chinese ramen in chinatown. I personally like knife shaved noodles and these are of the best I have had around chinatown. They are of a good size and thickness and perfectly chewy. They are very generous with the meat and it was melt in your mouth quality beef brisket.,2
"Noodles are what they do best, and that's what brought me back to this restaurant for the second time. It's a budget friendly spot to grab a bite in Chinatown. I really like the texture of the noodles here,  just a bit of chew, but still soft and lots of fun to eat. Everything else that goes with the noodles however doesn't quite stand out. Don't get me wrong, it's still delicious; an unhealthier version of what my mom would make. Maybe I've been spoiled by my moms cooking :p  The stir fried noodles are drowning in oil, and lots of msg used to add flavor to those cold dishes. It's hard to not like it, but so much regrets after. The portions are big but somehow I managed to clean the plate. As I wipe at my oil covered mouth from slurping the stir fried noodle, slowly realizing what I've done, my first instinct is that I should go on a juice cleanse tomorrow. However, as soon as I stepped out of the shop, I'm back to my normal self, thought of juice cleanse replaced by ""what should I have for dinner?""",1
This was just okay for me. There are so many hand pulled noodle places in Toronto now that I'm not sure this really stands out. They have generous noodle portions but not so many veggies. Meat was all right. I think my big mistake was getting the chicken wings which turned out being tasteless and with breading similar but (not as flavorful) as KFC. Oh well. On to the next place.,0
"I guess I'm becoming more health-conscious, but after loading up on carbohydrates in the form of noodles, I didn't feel great afterwards. The noodles themselves are a step above your ordinary noodles, I have to admit. They do a good job in the noddles department, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that I ate something that wasn't beneficial for my health or my body. That place was packed on a Friday evening, so I'm guessing it's pretty popular and has a loyal clientele. Despite good service, I probably won't be coming back as my diet and food preferences are slowly shifting toward healthy & nutritious food that good for my body. Everyone has to make their own choice. After all, you are what you eat. Food is medicine if you eat the right food.",1
"LUNCH  If I checked in on yelp every time I have came here for lunch, It would break the internet. The yelp data server would probably be filled with only my check ins lol. Yes, it is that much!  I always order the same thing when I come. Half BBQ pork (cha-siu) and half BBQ Chicken on rice.   Its gotten to the point where the owner and I just speak telepathically to each other. As soon as he sees me walking towards him, the lady is already preparing my meal lol.   Their sauce is crack man, I dunno what they put in it, but damn sun, Its mad delicious! Make sure you get some when ordering any bbq rice dish.   I am a big fan of this place as you can tell. Even Jon Snow would bend the knee if he ate here!  Long live the Noodle King! Ruler of the seven food courts, and true Heir to the Iron wok! ;)",2
"Noodle King is a little bit hard to find for first-timers. However, it's a very well known shop in PATH that every office worker in the Downtown area should know. You get a bowl filled with customizeable noodles/meat that is instantly made within just 1-2 minutes. My favourite is the BBQ Chicken Noodle Soup. The chicken is tender and flavourful. The soup is so appetizing that you'd want to finish the whole bowl - including the soup. You are free to choose the type of noodle/meat you like which I think it's a plus. I personally love the chewiness of the wonton noodles. There's also chili sauce available on the side. Overall food portion is sufficient - just enough that you will still be able to work after. The best part is pricing. This whole bowl of goodness costs less than $10 with tax included. It's probably one of the best deals in PATH food court.   The line can be long during lunch hours so you should avoid 12-1 pm.",2
"I was going through one of my carb-craving phases last week and came back to Noodle King for a decent bowl of egg noodles!  The line was fairly short as I managed to avoid the lunch rush at 1:30PM as it was a long weekend on a Friday.   The service is always efficient and you don't have to wait long to get your hot delicious bowl. Most of their toppings are on display including the veggies, proteins (fish balls, beef balls, chicken leg) etc. The noodles are pre-cooked then heated up quickly in a vat of hot water then transferred to a bowl of steaming soup.  This time around I got fish balls with egg noodles. There was an abundance of fish balls with chewy egg noodles. The soup was subtly flavored which I always douse in hot sauce. Perfect lunch meal that doesn't leave you too full but enough to satisfy cravings. Total came to about $7!",2
"Yes, yes, yes and so much yes. You want noodle soup, you go here. The End.   I eat here an embarrassing amount.  I've had the wonton shrimp noodle soup, the pork noodle soup, and the bbq chicken noodle soup and they're all delish.  And not overpriced.  The food court this place is in is a little dingy (compared to other food courts nearby) but the food is worth it. At lunch during the week, this place has a huge lineup - but it goes very fast.  My personal favourite is the bbq chicken which is somehow so much more tender than the regular rotisserie style chicken.   If you want noodle soup and you don't go here, you are totally missing out.",2
"Well, damn. This place is just too good to be stuck in a dimly lit food court with a dimly lit sign in the middle of almost nowhere.  Of course, I've had it bookmarked for a pretty long time after seeing the outstanding reviews, but it took stumbling upon it by accident while getting lost in the PATH to actually try it out. Definitely one of the best hidden gems I've ever been to! The noodles are absolutely delicious, and the broth was so savoury I literally gulped it down. The shrimp wontons? Huge! I was really surprised to see the enormous pieces of shrimp packed in them. The vegetables were super fresh too - no wilted leaves here! And nothing tasted like the artificial or over-seasoned MSG filled stuff you might expect at a food court (or elsewhere). Can this place open up other locations already??? I think it can give even some of the popular restaurants uptown a run for their money. :P  Can I also just say again, bless you Yelp, you're doing great work :D",2
"This is my new and fave go-to lunch spot on work days not only because it's a convenient 30 second walk from my office, but because it's cheap and delicious!   I've tried a number of their menu options and noodle selections, but my favourite has to be the pork wonton noodle soup with egg noodles. The pork wontons are huge and juicy, packed with lots of flavour. The wonton wrapper is a bit thicker than normal wrappers, but I think this helps keep the flavour packed in. You get 5 of these in the dish and it also comes with 2 stalks of bok choy and 1 stalk of broccoli along with your choice of noodles and broth. Not a fan of the rice noodles (thin or thick) as they do not retain any of the flavour from the broth and are quite bland to eat on its own. But the egg noodles are great as they do hold in the rich and flavourful and not too salty broth. The portion of this dish is huge as well as it leaves me struggling to finish the whole bowl! Such a steal for only $7.41 after tax I might add.   Don't be discouraged by the long lines or shady food court location - this place is really a hidden gem and the lines move fast. They definitely know what they're doing and know how to win you over!",2
Really delicious tasting broth and large portion of noodles and pork dumplings. Good value.  Will definitely return to try the other flavours.,2
"Visited a Friday at 11h30am.. Within the next 15 minutes, the line up became huge. Ordered the spicy beef soup for 9.99, as well as fried pork dumplings (3 for 2.59)... Pop is a buck a can  Soup was beefy, meat was tender and tasty, broth was nice, noodles were a bit bland (Shangai style). Dumplings were tasty and worth it.",2
"The wonton is much much better compared to any other ones served in foodcourt. The best part is you can add fish balls for additional cost. If you don't like bak choy you can get broccoli instead.  If you like a kick to the flavour of the noodle, you can ask them to give you a little brisket sauce added to the broth. One of the best wonton noodles for foodcourt.   Will be back even when the walk is a little far from my office.",2
"I love eating here on my comfort food/cheat days.  They have classic Hong Kong style soup noodles and bbq rice dish.  The noodles are made to order.  They have rice noodles, thick noodles, egg noodles to choose from.  Toppings include beef balls, fish balls, bbq pork, shrimp wonton, prom wonton, chicken, lemongrass chicken, beef stew, and others.  Better yet you can pick and choose.  You can get additional toppings like half size wonton, tofu, or beef sauce to add-on.  You can also pick just broccoli or bak choy.  You can pick rice dish too.  There is vegetarian options.  Their soy bean drink is small but tasty.  Staff is nice and friendly.  Line is long but service is fast.",1
"I don't think I've ever given a 5 for a food court restaurant.. I can see why it's popular, plus it's funny there are 2 asian restaurants side by side; one clearly outdoing the other... The service was really friendly, I went at off peak (probably best when you see the lines online, I imagine it moves fairly quickly..). Good lunch for under 10 bucks, rare.",2
Go every Friday for lunch.  Love their shrimp dumpling noodle soup.  Very busy place but they move a lot customers quickly.,2
"Noodle King is an unassuming noodle stand in an underground food court. The noodles, broth, meat, and vegetables all were perfect! I ordered the BBQ pork bowl.",2
"Living in Markham & Scarborough before and now close to Chinatown, I had tasted the best and cheap noodle soup. So trying Noodle King for the first time, I wasn't really impressed.  Yes, their Shrimp Wontons are massively huge and I counted 5 pcs in my soup. So I guess that makes a difference considering they give you crappy servings when you eat in food court places.  But I still paid $8.19 for my soup which to me is still not that cheap. Still the soup didn't blow my mind or something.",1
"This place has the best Asian comfort food I've found in dt yet. Their shrimp wanton noodles are great and I've tried their BBQ chicken too, also delicious. The prices are more uptown prices than downtown, so it's cheaper than most food courts nearby. I try to come here every week or so.  Avoid peak times but if you see a long line, it moves fast. It's also open during the weekend which is great.",2
"Best, cheap and delicious eat in financial district as it gets! When I used to get long lunch breaks, I'd meet every friend to eat here. You don't come for the environment but for the speedy, delicious wonton noodles and soy milk beverage. Wish they had this uptown as well as it would be a great snack on weekends as well. 5/5 recommend and they have also have rice as well which are good!",2
"So this is a hidden gem buried under the Sheraton hotel. I usually go here before catching a show at the Four Seasons.   It's the smallest crappiest food court that one could imagine. I think there are 5 stalls. A subway, hero burger, a random Greek place and another place I can't remember. Then there's this place.   Family run joint service up awesome bowls of noodle soup and other dishes.   I only have ordered the vegetarian noodle soup (with egg noodles - my fave). Firstly, it's a huge portion with lots of veggies. Secondly it is loaded with veggies and fresh tofu. Thirdly it's cheap. $6 for a humongous portion. Fourthly it's very flavourful. Fifthly, the owners are really nice. Sixthly, there's no wait. Seventhly the broth is absolutely delicious. Eighthly, you should check out this hidden gem.   I always love finding hole in the ground (literally) pleases that serve up amazing food at cheap prices to only those that know about it.   Go eat here.",2
I have been here twice this week and it's all about knowing what's good.  Pork wonton soup with rice noodle - kinda meh. Broth was delicious but there wasn't enough. Was left with a bunch of soggy rice noodles without much flavour. 5/10  Spicy beef noodle soup - awesome! Fatty beef with egg noodles swimming in spicy deliciousness. Get the spicy sauce. 10/10  And it's all pretty cheap(+0.5)  So average it out and it's a pretty good (8/10) cheap lunch place.,2
The place is at the Sheraton's food court in the concourse level. So glad I read the previous reviews and gave it a try... you will not be disappointed.  The wontons are so good. I tried the shrimp and ordered one piece of the pork wonton to try. They both were amazing!  I'm so cautious to order dumplings because they look/taste like mystery meat but not here. These dumplings are so tasty and good quality filling.,2
"Great food for the price. Filling, tasty and fresh, definitely recommend for a quick meal!",2
Its was a great place to explore such delicious Chinese food. Enjoy it and the owner was super friendly.. and staff are great. lot of  food selections..all dish we ordered come out so good.. love this place.. ..  definitely will  come back again...,2
Good take-out place with well-priced specials each day for the price of $4.99 before tax.  Went here on a whim and ordered the Sunday specials of eggplant tofu on rice and BBQ chicken leg.  You get what you pay for.  Greasy more than flavourful.  It is delicious in comforting way.  The hot and sour soup was plenty hot but not sour enough.  Service was brisk and abrupt.  Seems to be frequented by students and there's a bit of a language barrier.  Not particularly motivated to try it again in the future no matter what the price point could be.,0
Much better quality than other Chinese food restaurants in the East end outside of East Chinatown. Chili chicken is nice,2
I've been doing some causal quick drop in meals here for a bit and just wanted to pass a review about the epic pick up meal I had today. My GF and I stopped in mid day and ordered a couple meals worth of food to go. I Mist say their dumplings are amongst the best I've had. We mostly ordered typical dim sum fair but I also had the salt fried shrimp which as usual was epic. Shrimp fried rice outstanding. I should add the curry squid was out of control. This is a lovely family run business and I hope they get through the next weeks as they're an absolute gem.,2
"We were in the neighborhood and couldn't decide what to eat so we did what others would do in our situation which was to bust out our phones and go on Yelp for suggestions! Well Yelp led us to this place based on its high ratings but I'm sad to say that Yelp has failed me again.  This restaurant's dimsum quality was not good. The curry cuttlefish was very watery and bland, their chicken feet had a weird taste, their sui mai was okay but again kind of bland, their spare ribs was full of fat and the list goes on and on with negative things to say about their other dishes. None was good!  Service was okay but their debit machine was down and I didn't have cash on me and when I asked if they take e- transfers, they said no. So I had to drive out to a bank to get cash which was a bit of a pain but of well.  Definitely will not comes back to this one.",0
"Unfortunately, this area does not have any other nearby places for dim sum. So there are no competitive prices for morning dim sum, and the food itself is not the best, when compared to restaurants in Markham, etc. However, considering this is the only place available, I think it's a good option when you're craving dim sum and do not want to commute or drive for an hour.  We tried the seafood dumplings (very doughy), fish congee (really nice), fried shrimp dumplings (tasty, essentially fried har gow), and spinach dumplings (very doughy). I do not eat meat and so didn't try the siu mai, tripe and pepper short rib, but heard that the latter two were quite tough and chewy.   The staff was very friendly and accommodating. If we're in the area again and hungry for dim sum, I would come back, but it would not be my first choice. Most dishes were $4-5, and our bill came to $40 total.",2
"Went inside randomly cause I wanted some chinese food but didnt get the kind i was expecting. Needless to say this restaurant has completely opened my eyes to how delicious authentic chinese food is. You literally see these people make everything fresh infront of you too, its not some premade stuff they pull out of a container its legit ingredients. The people were super friendly and accomodating too, even though i walked in with no cash the guy pointed me out to a bunch of places with ATMs and apologized for it, was really chill even though I wasnt sure of what i wanted and suggested the safest choices and what he thought i would like. Stellar service, most places cant get you out of the door fast enough and i cant go back to those fake chinese food places, they dont compare to this hidden gem. If you're in Toronto and you want good food get it from here people!",2
"Honestly, a pretty solid place. The prices are great and it's a little weird that they're not open for lunch/brunch, but if you're craving dim sum for dinner then this is your spot. The dim sum is fresh and seems to be made with quality ingredients. Tastes similar enough to some of the other places in the city that I would come here for the savings. Some odd items were not as good: shui mai, and fried green onion pancake was SUPER doughy and not flakey. But other items were great: har gow, spinach shrimp dumplings, fried turnip cake, fried rice, etc. I generally judge a dim sum place by its har gow so this is 5 stars.  Would come back.",2
"We have been here for takeout a few times here. Remember its CASH ONLY so pack those 20 bills. I really liked their dim sum sampler, with classic dumplings like shrimp and seafood. I would recommend the dim sum sampler over their dishes.",1
"I was craving dim sum and found this place near me via a google search. The rave reviews had me on my way. I was not disappointed! Fabulous food, friendly and quick service, clean but simple ambiance.  I ordered the dim sum sampler for only $15. It was so filling, hot, delicious and everything I could have asked for. I'll be back and I mean soon and I'm bringing family and friends.",2
Came here for lunch. And the lady working here was so happy that someone speaking Cantonese with her. So cute It's very local dim sum place just similar HK style  I used to eat every weekend for dim sum when I was living in HK. So I miss it so much!! Their material and ingredients are very fresh and great deal for the price :) deff going again soonnnnnn!!! Love it here!,2
"This place has some tasty treats! I enjoyed a curry and onion dish with the most tender baby squid. So delicious! There were shrimp balls, steamed shrimp dumplings, beef balls with chive and plain. So good, but somehow we didn't order classic dim sum! Go figure.   The atmosphere was hole in the wallish (typically a good thing) and in this case it was a good thing indeed. Prices were fair and the fillings of the dishes were generous.   Seating was a bit uncomfortable, but the warm tea was nice. Friendly server as well. Rad sign out front too. I forgot to take a photo of it, but here are the photos I did grab!",2
"I think I set my expectations too high for this place. Being chinese I keep hearing how good the dim sum was in toronto. I studied Yelp for a good while trying to find a dim sum place with good reviews. I looked at all different menus from different places and decided on this place. It was cash only so I had money exchanged after we crossed into Canada. We drove 2 hours (there was traffic) to get there. Had to pay for parking. It was a small hole in the wall place with literally 8 small tables total. I've been in many hole in the walls so no judging there...especially if the taste of the food was out of this world good! Not in this case...I must say that I've had better dim sum at a mediocre place in VA. MD by far has the best dim sum so if you're in the Rockville area, try out the dim sum there, both Cantonese and Taiwanese style!  Anyways my family liked it but their not Chinese (my mixed family of Blasians) so to them, dim sum is dim sum. They did agree that we have better dim sum back home in VA/MD.  The selection wasn't as great either but I did see the cook in the back making the dumplings fresh. My youngest son love dumplings and he commented that it wasn't as good as my mom's lol. Duh..of course grandma makes the best dumplings.  The server was very nice but we wont be back. Dont believe the hype! Or at least not from here.",1
"Totally tasty and dependable dim sum outside of Chinatown. I usually get their combo and it's more than enough food with great variety - though it doesn't include any steamed buns, sadly. It's not the prettiest place on the danforth but it's a great take out option when you're having that shu mei craving.",2
"Spinich garlic shrimp was great. Beef shu mai was a little salty. Sour and sweet pork was too dry and hard to chew, so they replaced it with sour and sweet chicken.  It is cash only!",1
"Went today with my boyfriend to try the dim sum over the weekend and was disappointed. Got there at 1:30 PM and ordered about four or five different dim sum's and was told to wait while it was being made.   The order was for take out. Waited for an hour and a bit and still no end in sight of when I would get my order. I must've seen five Uber eats pick up their orders way after me and there were two or three people behind the line that got seated for dine in, and got served their food before me getting my order.   After waiting patiently for an hour for my take out order to be completed I went up to the cashier and told them to cancel our order since it wasn't even made at that point. All they said was that they were really backed up. I spoke to both workers and said this isn't right that you guys didn't tell us we have to wait A whole hour for take out. We have been standing at the restaurant at the lineup for a whole hour and still our order was not made at that point in time. Poor Organization.",0
"Worst Chinese food ever. It's places like this that give Chinese food a bad name. Threw out 75% of our order.   Ordered what I thought would be staple Cantonese dishes that any decent place would find hard to screw up. Well guess what, Ha Gow managed to do just that. The seafood fried noodles were capital B bland - would it have hurt them to put even one drop of soy sauce? They also used cheap shrimp and squid that had no flavour. We also ordered the fried shrimp with spicy salt. This is honestly the most basic Cantonese dish (equivalent to fries for a Canadian restaurant). Well what came were those cheap shrimps they used for the noodles but smothered in a thick batter (they looked like balls of grease). Each bite oozed with grease and didn't taste like shrimp at all.  The other dishes ordered were equally bad. Seafood dumpling (all it tasted of was MSG), steamed squid in ginger and onion (think rubber bands laced with MSG), and shrimp rolls (no flavour). The spinach & shrimp dumpling was the only thing decent item.   Avoid, avoid, avoid.",0
"The service was friendly, the place was definitely clean, and the food was good and affordable. I wasn't there long and didn't try many dishes, so I can't say too much, but I can at least say that I would return if I were in the area again.",2
"The number one dim sum and mom-and-pop shop in Toronto - hands down. The dim sum comes out steamy hot and the dishes are deliciously flavourful!   We ordered the ha how, siu mai, garlic squid, spinach dumpling, and a bunch of other dishes too. For 2 people, I suggest ordering at least  6 or 7 dishes (each are around $3-4). Our total came to $35 with tax and tip. This restaurant is a definitely among my top 10 places to eat in Toronto. I am in a dim sum nirvana just reminiscing about our dinner here. Only locals know about this place so it's almost never packed.  Pro tip: You need to order at the counter. So pick up an order slip, choose wisely on your fav dishes, and hand it back to the person behind the counter.   Prop tip 2: You'll need to ""self-serve"". So grab your plates, chopsticks, tea, etc. They only bring you the food. The food makes up for this so I don't care.  Prop tip 3: There's tables that seat up to 4, so don't come with a crowd of 10 or more.   Transit directions: Take the TTC to Donlands Station, walk towards Danforth (turn right when you exit the station entrance) and then when you're on Danforth, look straight across. It's a bit hidden, but well worth the find.  When we were here, there was a white dude working with the Chinese mom, dad, and uncle. We had speculated that he was adopted but didn't ask. Anyways, they were all super nice.   Pro tip 4: They deliver locally and have lunch specials.  I wish I lived nearby because I'd be here at least once a week. It's my dim sum secret place, more of an ""super elite spot"" in my books. In comparison, the food here is far superior than compared to any dim sum restaurant near Dundas and Spadina. I think it's their family recipes that are used and the fact that the owners really care about the art of dim sum making. A must eat!",2
"I love dim sum. This is one of my favourite dim sum place as its in a convenient location (just a few steps from Donlands station) and pricing is reasonable. A plate of dim sum starts from $2.90. Depending what you order.  Its fresh, fast and affordable pricing with good portions. They also have dishes served apart from dim sum like long green bean str fry with black beans served with rice which is my favourite.  They have a self serve style which you order and pay at the counter and they will bring you the food. Chinese tea and water is situated at a corner for self replenishment. Its a quick, fuss-free self serve style of dim sum. Bonus is, they do delivery too.",2
"Dim Sum is definitely 4.5, excellent taste and I highly recommend the Steamed Bean Curd Skin Roll/Meat with Japanese mushroom and the steamed spare ribs. The reason why I have not rated it a 5 Star is because of the ambiance. It's a little small and a cash only establishment. Otherwise, you can't go wrong with the food.",2
"Dim sum wasn't bad. I actually preferred this over the downtown China Town dim sum, but markham was better. But if don't feel like a drive thru traffic, not a bad second choice.  Ignore the decor or I think if they rearranged some stuff it would look good.   Service was attentive but only one server who did everything so be patient. Other reviewers did mention they were out of certain items...which if they were, they should inform us and not have it on the board.  Will go back...",1
Got to this place recently. The shrimp dumplings were delicious. At least to my tastes. It has been a long time since I last got dim sum so I can't really compare to other places but I certainly enjoyed my meal and would like to come back again.,2
"A little on the pricy side but that's what you get when you dine in Yorkville. The dim sum is honestly very good, surpassed only perhaps in value by the crown princess a little further down Bay street. A few non-dim sum dishes are excellent as well, including their Singapore noodles and Bok Choy.   Their staff are as professional as they come. A very pleasant dim sum experience",2
"Worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant!  The service was so slow; we got our food after exactly one hour. Also, the server didn't speak English, was aggressive, and had an attitude.  Moreover, the food was served colder than usual and was extra oily.  We tried to address the issue to the manager but he said: ""it's okay"".  I don't recommend even giving this restaurant a try!",0
"You can truly taste the difference in quality of dim sof Dynasty compare to other dim sum places downtown Toronto.  The dishes are flavourful and fresh.  I highly recommend calling in to reserve a table, otherwise expect to wait 20-30 mins for one.  The only downside is that customer service isnt so great.  Once you place your order, your food will come when dishes are ready.  The waiters will not come check up on you. Ive noticed this when it is a full house of customers.",2
"Parking here sucks and the place is rammed, but it's worth it. Best dim sum in the area.  We pretty much enjoyed everything we ordered, but here are some of the stand out dishes:  bbq pork bun (specifically the baked one) mushroom udon jellyfish Har gow deep fried tofu Honey black pepper short ribs (salted) egg custard buns",2
Food was tasty.  Eyelash found in tripe dish.  Guy tried to give us leftovers.  Prices are not available unless you ask. FYI here are the prices.,1
"Dynasty is a decent spot if you're looking for Chinese food in the area. The place is nice inside (given its location in Yorkville), and the food selection is quite typical - similar to those found in other Cantonese restaurants. Nothing out of the ordinary. They offer an evening dim sum menu (a slightly condensed version of the regular dim sum selection). Service is pretty good and food comes out quick.",1
"Pricey but good dimsum. Less fatty and greasy than traditional. Good service. The meals looked good, but I only tried the dimsum",2
"I went for an early dinner and there was one other couple in the restaurant. It slowly picked up with large and noisey families. The good was good. Wontons were a bit greasy but fresh. Dumplings were great. Hate asking for red wine vinegar when I visit dim sum restaurants, as I did here, just leave a bottle on the table next to the soy sauce. Sticky rice was hot but lacked much flavour. No refills on soft drinks. Host was great, server was OK. Nicely decorated room",1
I have been here in three years and the quality has definitely come down.  We ordered the chicken fried rice which had no carrots or peas just rice and chicken. It tasted ok.  The sesame chicken was way too sweet and tasted like a chicken Tim bit.  The dim sum was below average for the price. There are definitely better and cheaper options. I a long time customer will not be returning.,0
Tried the Dim Sum at dinner time- the quality leaves much to be desired although the food was hot and served with typical efficient minimalist ( they did top up your tea promptly) service. The Xiao long bao was completely dry; Char siew bao was dry and flakey ( below expectations). Pricey for the lack of quality.  Saw that they had Tiger beer which was a pleasant surpise   We probably won't be coming back again .,0
"Dynasty serves high quality authentic Cantonese dim sum, in a very nice, high end setting.  We had the traditional, har gow, shui mai, and char siu bars.  We also had the turnip cake.  Portions are small here, but quality and taste were great!  It is very different than Chinatown where the variety is a little larger, but if you come to the Yorkville neighborhood for Cantonese dim sum you will not be disappointed!",2
We tried this place since it's close to our hotel and shopping places.  The ambiance was great and place looks clean. But the service needs a lot of work. The hot and sour soup is terribly spicy and no taste. Just the hot spice. So I ordered another soup. The wonton soup. It took them almost 30 minutes to bring my soup out. And likewise no taste and very UN-CHINESE flavor.  We also asked one waiter about a cocktail mix and he initially gave me the impression that he does not want to be asked about the drinks and the menu. The waiter said I'll get back it's you but he never did come back. Almost All waiters and servers here are very UNFRIENDLY AND NO SMILE at all. Very disappointing place.!!!!,0
"We ordered dim sums. They were all very good. But the service was a little slow: we had to ask twice for some tea, twice for the bill, and never got the sauce we asked for. It looks like no waiter in particular was in charge of our table.",1
It was way over priced for the type of food you get. One particular waiter was very rude (Tony). The other waiters were polite but the ratio of wait staff to patrons was not balanced. We had trouble just getting water or trying to get our bill.,0
"Last week, I decided to get take out from a nearby restaurant. They said it would take twenty minutes, so I decided to walk around instead of waiting at the restaurant. I had killed some time and by the time I had looped around, I thought hey maybe I can grab one of my favorite treats as dessert. Dynasty was right there, so I went upstairs, proceeded to the counter, looked at their priceless* dim sum menu and ordered one order of the steamed egg yolk custard buns.  I said priceless with an * because I wanted to explain that it didn't have a price next to the items... Not because there menu is super precious. Boy did I ever experience sticker shock. Yes, I do remember Dynasty is over priced and the food is average here. But when I paid over $10 for three tiny buns...I couldn't help but think: didn't I pay just four dollars for three of these, but slightly larger ones, at Rol San a few weeks ago?   Okay, so maybe the quality is why it's priced higher, I thought. So after eating amazing Indian food for dinner, I dug into the custard buns. The filing is kinda dry... Atop of this, there's some weird film/coating around the ""custard""/yolk. I assume it's edible, because it's in all three, and I ate it. But if I had to compare it against other custard buns that I've had... I'd much prefer a creamy custard instead of something dried up. I don't think of custards as something dried up ever.  There was a time when the buns were good here... Years ago. Its a shame because the other items in the menu here really are average and over priced.",0
"I brought my dad, stepmom and half siblings here for dinner as they were visiting from Vietnam and craving some Chinese food and I wanted to take them somewhere classier than the Chinatown restaurants.  BIG MISTAKE.  You can take a girl out of Chinatown, but you CAN'T take the Chinatown out of a girl!!! The service was not good.   First of all, for the area and price point, I expected to be able to ask the servers about the menu but apparently they don't know why is popular or well-liked. Secondly, my dad and stepmom had a quiet hushed disagreement and the server near us started giving them dirty looks. Everything else was based on lack experience from the servers. Appetizers coming out at the end of the meal, lack of napkins despite having three kids at the table, failure to clear emptied dishes.    The food was pretty good. While it could not make up for the poor service, I would order takeout from them but I will not dine in again unless there are extenuating circumstances.",1
"We were wandering through Yorkville and looking for something to eat when we spotted Dynasty Chinese Cuisine. Dim sum in the middle of Yorkville? Sure, why not.  We requested a seat on their patio and the waiting began. Our waiter finally showed up with menus a few minutes later but honestly, I was baffled (and a little annoyed) by its vagueness. The dim sum menu is devoid of prices, and since our waiter appeared only sporadically, we had to wait a while before we could even begin choosing our food. (Like, if everything is going to cost $10, we certainly weren't going to stay. And because this is Yorkville, that's absolutely a possibility.)  Anyway, he finally explained the menu and the costs, so we decided to order six items. The food was all fine. There were no really distinctive flavors to be found but everything was prepared relatively well. (We did get a short-rib dish that was basically inedible due to a preponderance of bone and cartilage, however.)  I had to wait a while to start eating, though, because I needed a fork and, surprise surprise, our waiter was nowhere to be found.  With service like this and food that's just barely passable, it's hard to envision returning.",1
Generally good but the beef belly is actually tripe and it comes out almost immediately which is highly suspicious.,2
"Dim sum in the heart of Yorkville, honestly coming from Richmond Hill (read: right beside Markham!) I wasn't expecting much. I expected average, bland tasting classics like har gow (shrimp dumplings) and siu mai (steamed pork bites wrapped in wonton-like skin). We arrived as a table of 7 on a weekday and the place was fairly empty - understandable, dim sum usually is a longer meal not favoured for a workday lunch hour. We ordered a bit of everything and some of us were looking for specific items - everyone found what they were looking for! There were a decent variety and many classics on the menu - some that aren't often found even in Markham because they're complex to make and don't sell for high prices.  The highlights were the fritter wrapped in rice roll, the osmanthus cake, and the mini octopus in curry sauce. Often the rice rolls are squishy and lack texture, but this one was a good consistency that complemented the crunchy (not chewy!) dough fritter. The osmanthus cake came with a base layer of coconut milk, providing additional flavour and texture that agreed with the table's demands for desserts that're not too sweet but still *something*. We also ordered steamed sponge cake - it was soft and fluffy, steaming hot. The realization the sponge cake was steamed baffled some, and the softness and light flavour was well received. It could've had more of the signature taste, but it was a decent attempt at the classic.  Overall for the location I was pleasantly surprised, and prices were aligned to the area as well. Unfortunately from a dim sum in Toronto perspective, I didn't feel like it was anywhere close to great and it definitely wasn't worth the price paid. Service was good and accommodating to the non-Chinese speakers, but translations were odd and made it more difficult to understand what things were in some cases. I'll be back for team lunches looking for exotic options and a group feeling because we're all at a round table, but aside that I'll stick with my suburb options.",1
"Came here to celebrate my Friends Birthday, Food is good but for the price its not worth it.service not good. I ask them if they can do something for her like candle and small dessert..And she said yeah we can do that..And I was waiting for it and she forgot and I felt bad that I have to said it infront of my friend when it supposed to be surprise.He said that they don't have anything like that but We saw that they did it on the other table.By the way we paid around $500 for that small portion of food and Bad service!",0
"This appears to be an old school family run Chinese restaurant. Great food crossed with a modest priority on establishment decor.  We had the spicy sliced chicken, pork with vegetables, won ton and hot and sour soup, beef fried rice.  Every dish was really really good. The spicy chicken was wicked spicy and was utterly fantastic!  The fellow waiting on use was confident, very nice and helpful.  Will be back when in the area.",2
"Very cheap lunch specials of 6.99, variety of stews with rice and noodles are amazing. You can always taste the fresh vegtebales which is amazing.  This is not a luxury or beautiful place the food is good quality and cheap.  Don't forget the forun cookie also cash for lunch special.",2
"As newcomers to Toronto the food scene is very new to us, cuz took us here as his previous dining experience had been fantastic. We have been here twice in three weeks specifically for one dish the hot pepper chicken. They have recently renovated and had no one told me, I would definitely say the place needs an upgrade. Pointy long chair, tables with plastic table cloth considering the greasy nature of the Sichuan food. The menu is ellobrate with enough items for vegetarians as well as those who need their share of meat, pork to fish. A party of particularly hungry people we called in for the following:  SLICED FISH IN GARLIC SAUCE: Boneless steamed fish, had this distinct flavor of the garlic and could be eaten all by itself. Makes for a great appetizer  BEEF IN BLACK BEAN SAUCE: sliced beef pieces served with peppers in black bean sauce, so well cooked, a light gravy it tastes well with the rice and as an appetizer.  CHICKEN HOT PEPPER: this was the main. Now if you like the fire of the peppercorns, only then you should venture here. It is a big bowl of chicken, napa cabbage, and peppercorns in gravy. Large portion size, must be eaten with rice or it will flame you. Lovely. Highly recommended.  EGG FRIED RICE: serves as a catalyst for the spice of the Sichuan, as the bland of the rice soothes The flavor.  The second time around we decided to explore the menu a little more and called for MARINATED RIBS: the meat almost melted in my mouth and tastes delicious. It's a good side dish and if you are ok with bones it is a recommended item.  EGGPLANT IN CHILLI GARLIC SAUCE: I have always liked the Chinese eggplant and wanted the cuz and husband to try it so we got this as an appetizer while we waited for the food. Very recommended if you are a Vegetarian or plan to eat vegetables while here.  CHICKEN HOT PEPPER EGG AND SHRIMP FRIED RICE: They accidently brought this out instead of the egg rice, we were hungry and kept it. Does the job.  I like the flavor of the food and for the chicken pepper we would be returning again. There is a lot that can be done in terms of tables and sitting arrangement, it stinks at times as well. Apart from that the food is great, the service was also not bad. Overall a 3.5-4/5 and does have a repeat value.",2
"If you like your Chinese food to be spicy then this is the place for you. A friend of mine introduced me to Southern Chinese cuisine which she said would appeal to my Indian taste buds. I've been hooked ever since.   The sliced fish in chilli oil with Sichuan peppers is a must-try! It's very spicy but goes so well with a bowl of steamed rice. We also tried a plate of green (not sure what it was) but it was so garlicky and yum!   I look forward to going back and trying more items on the menu, the quantity is large so it's a perfect place to go with a group of people.",2
"I come to 川味轩 occasionally and every time think to myself ""oh no looks like they closed down"" because of the state of disrepair of the storefront.   Once inside, it's the same familiar servers and that awful plaid carpet. The prices haven't changed much over the years and neither has the menu, although I did notice the portions are smaller. I always get the lunch specials Kung Pao chicken, a tofu dish and spicy cold noodles which never disappoints. Lunch specials come with a soup of the day.   Tasty, good value and a viable option if you are willing to relax your standards of cleanliness.",1
"It looks really sketchy outside but don't like it scare u away, cuz the food is pretty good! Let's talk about the 4 dishes we ordered:  1. Dan dan noodles. Okay I'm pretty sure it is not the authentic dan dan noodles but the way they presented it was pretty smart. All the spicy sauce is on the bottom of the bowl because if u can't take that much spicy then u don't have to stir all into the noodles. But other than that no comments. 2. Chicken dry pot. We ordered this because other three plate wasn't enough. It came on a stove and a pot, it tastes amazing but the fire down the stove is just really concerning I wish they could use some protection around it. 3. Spicy beef. ITS SO GOOD and SO SPICY. I freakin loved it!! I'm not joking about the spicy level of this dish so if u can't really take real spicy u need to bring ice milk with u. Also u need to try the numbing pepper that Sichuan cuisine has, it will numb ur tongue and it is such a cool sensation. 4. Double cooked pork belly. It's extremely salty, like super duper salty. We had to order rice to eat this.   The service: the waiters and waitresses hang around but they r really slow at services.",1
"Tried this out in a spur of the moment decision, on a trip to Toronto. Excellent Sichuan cuisine. Prompt friendly service. Too bad they don't accept visa (requiring me to have my friend pay in cash, and hence the reduced rating).   Reasonably priced food!",2
"TL;DR Delicious Chinese food but not exactly authentic Sichuan.   We ordered takeout on a Saturday night - green beans with pork, gong bao chicken, and mapo tofu.   The green beans with pork was a standout, the beans tasted fresh while nicely fried at the same time, the dish could have used slightly larger pork crumbs though.   The gongbao chicken was definitely not authentic - it was a bit saucy compared to the normal version and the chicken pieces were larger than normal. It was not spicy at all and maybe a bit sweet. It was still tasty.   The mapo tofu was also a standout - a bit spicy and very flavourful.  The portions were large and generous. We can't comment on cleanliness or service since we ordered delivery via DoorDash.   One star off since neither of us felt like it was authentic Sichuan cuisine - too much cornstarch and a tad too sweet. It was tasty nonetheless. Side note, we both had poor stomaches a few hours after dinner. Can't tell if it was from the meal, just figured we'd add in case.",1
"The pictures are sour soup fish, cabbage with mushroom, and tofu with sliced pork. The manager really wanted us to pay with cash. But they accept debit card too. It's also pretty spacious and there are many items on menu. WiFi is available.",2
"I went with a friend who recommended this place. I was not disappointed. We both love spicy food and although the food wasnt super spicy (probably because I have a high tolerance to spice) it was delicious nonetheless. We really enjoyed our meal of spicy chicken with chili, mapo tofu and shrimp fried rice. A word of caution though, some people, might find the food a tad salty but for me it was perfect. I love me some salt. The servers were really nice as well. It made the meal that much better.   PS: place is way bigger than it looks on the outside. I was very surprised.",2
"A Chinatown staple.   When you're feeling the bright lights of Chinatown, and hunting lazy susans and plastic chopsticks, SG is here for you.   When you're feeling your couch and are ready to drop $60 on a true Chinese Canadian feast, SG is here for you.   My fave dishes include: veggie fried rice, spicy broccoli and their General Tsao's chicken.",2
"Location: poor atmosphere, looks like the cliche Chinese restaurant right out of a movie. No eye appeal whatsoever.   Food: ordered the chicken fried rice and the beef with ginger and spring onions. Being used to eating foods flavored with haberno peppers, we had them make our dishes spicy. The rice was very flavorful and nicely spiced. The beef dish was ok, didn't really stand alone well but mixed with the rice It was good. The water cups looked really dingy, which I didn't drink out of it Bc of that reason.   Overall: food was good, if you don't mind the appearance of the place, I'd say go for it.",1
"Still one of my favorite original Chinatown establishments. I love the staff here - all bilingual and super friendly and treats you like family, especially if you speak Mandarin ;) Whenever I get cravings for traditional Chinese vegetarian dishes like lotus root, Chinese mushroom and fungus, mapo tofu, etc I come here. I also come here when I feel ""heritage-sick"" and need to reconnect with people who remind me of my family. Many customers here are regulars and know the staff personally.   They will make all sorts of accommodations for dietary restrictions or special diets, such as vegan/vegetarian, e.g. mapo tofu usually is made with meat so remember to tell them at the beginning that you are vegetarian.   Downsides are that they put way too much cornstarch, salt, and MSG in all of the mains. I definitely don't recommend the ""Bamboo shoots with Chinese mushrooms"" dish as everything was literally swimming in a broth of corn starch and the bamboo shoot was a bit stinky (as it should be, but just note that it is an acquired taste). I recommend the mapo tofu - it isn't that spicy at all! Also recommend the mixed vegetable stirfry, which contains Chinese black fungus (so yummy and crunchy!) and lotus root. This one has less corn starch and is on the lighter side.  Prices are low - most dishes are under $10 - and portion sizes are large. Rice/carbs do not come automatically with main dishes, so you do have to order these separately.  They accept card as well as cash.  Will be back!",2
"This restaurant was formerly known as ""Sichuan Garden Restaurant"" and re-opened last year as ""Ten Miles B.B.Q"".  After reading positive reviews about their Dan Dan Noodles and Sichuan cuisine I popped in alone for a quick lunch.  I was greeted with a very confusing menu.   I wanted to order a few sides, but was advised by the server that my selections were too small. She did not suggest any alternatives.  All of the multiple small plates seem to have only one ingredient and no options for combination dishes like a mixed vegetable platter. I am happy to pay more for more content, but $12 for just bok choy? $6 for one small skewer of basic mushrooms? had to call her over twice until she finally helped me narrow it down to Dan Dan Noodles and a mushroom pot. I was hungry and desperate to order anything at this point.  THEY GAVE ME THE BILL BEFORE THE FOOD ARRIVED.  The Dan Dan Noodles were tasty, but after that the server and kitchen staff seemed to prioritize take out orders over mine.  At about 45 mins + from when I walked I had to flag two servers to ask about the mushroom pot I had ordered.  The kitchen staff had only just started the dish! At that point I paid for what I had eaten and walked out.    If you want UNHELPFUL ,SLOW & UNATTENTIVE servers and kitchen staff that (prioritize Uber Eats orders over sit down guests) and don't own up to their mess ups than you might enjoy this restaurant.  I myself will NEVER RETURN.  There are thousands of restaurants in the GTA. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY on this one! P.S. The management was non-existent. P.P.S. THEY GAVE ME THE BILL BEFORE I HAD EVEN RECEIVED THE FOOD!",0
"Inauthentic and bland. Red flags: No classic numbing spice flavor. Missed the spot on 2 signature dishes so I won't be coming back.   The cold noodles appetizer was had noodles that were thick and tasted like spaghetti and old lard. No complimentary contents either--you can usually expect some sesame oil or thinly chopped black fungus or something but this was a low effort fail completely.   The ""mouth watering chicken"" which is a cold chicken dish was sitting in a pool of chili oil and soy sauce (which is normal) but completely lacked flavor and spice--it should carry the sweet flavor of cooking wine, the saltiness of soy sauce and have the savory ""ma la"" numbing spice that makes your lips and tongue tingle. The only thing resembling the classic dish was the fact that the chicken was rather bony and gristly. I had to ask for more hua jiao (si chuan pepper) oil to make it edible   I'm horribly disappointed and the two dishes cost me $14. It's overpriced at this rate. The decor is austere but rundown (fake wooden footbridge leading into banquet style restaurant that looks tatty) and I guess the fact it was empty on a Friday evening at 9 was highly suspect. Please just go to Si Chuan house cuisine if you're looking for anything nearly close to spicy",0
Cockroaches running around.  This place is very dirty and the food isn't nice.  I would not recommend unless you are asking for a stomach ache.,0
"I am a bit torn by this rating. I would give it a 2.5 if I could. I was a little freaked out my the fruit flies hovering around my table but I put it aside. Hopefully the kitchen is clean, but what can I do about it, nothing. I order two dishes I get at Trizest, a Sichuan place near my home, in Michigan. The Cold Sichuan noodles were good but a bit bland. The portion size of the small would easily feed two. The Ma Po tofu was again, a large portion. It did seem to lack the Sichuan peppercorns and the mouth numbing effect. I'm a fan of salty but it was way salty. I think it was the preserved black beans that put it over the top. My dish didn't come with rice so I had to order some on the side. All in all it was good, but I wouldn't make a pilgrimage here.",1
"Came here with my family for a special dinner, and we all really enjoyed it! We were super hungry and walked in when the place was quite empty, so our food came out within 10 minutes. The ma po tofu and eggplant skillet were our favourite dishes - very flavourful. The kung bao chicken with peanuts and wonton soup were also really good. We were underwhelmed with the seafood and vegetable plate though... The flavour just wasn't that great.  Our server was nice... She came by whenever we needed her and kept our teapot full. They didn't have any dessert options which seems strange to me? Really though, we ate our weight in the ma po tofu, so it was probably for the best that there was no dessert.",2
"Sweet and sour soup was good. Dumplings were good.  Our meals were bleh. Had Tsao chicken, which looked very nice but was more deep fried pieces than chunks of chicken.  My spouse had chicken with ginger and scallions which he enjoyed. A friend had some beef dish that was indescribable.",0
"Amazing for a few dishes. Meh for some others. Know your dishes before you order.  Gong Bao Chicken is AMAZING. Best Gong Bao Chicken I've had anywhere. The fish in spicy oil is good too.  Some of their other dishes, not so much. Came here with some non-asian friends, the stuff they ordered was gah. So essentially, good restaurant IF you know what to order.",2
"I've eaten here twice with my kids when visiting ChinaTown. They talk about it like it was the best meal of their lives :). And I swear I'm actually a good cook! The dumplings are delicious.  It is a tiny downstairs spot that you might walk right by. And I think we were the only tourists.   But if you want something authentic and inexpensive, I definitely recommend.  Service is friendly and what lacks in presentation they make up for in flavour",2
"I am a huge fan of Xian style Biang Biang Mein. I haven't found a place in Toronto that makes this. Therefore, when I found a picture of this dish on their ad outside I had to try it. It is strange that I could not find a yelp review. However, there were plenty of google reviews on this restaurant.  It's own by a couple and I feel they gear their restaurant to Chinese speaking customers. Their English is quite weak. I ordered the Biang Biang noodles and steam dumplings. I wrote the number down and wrote the English name on the paper. The lady had to clarify what I meant with another customer. They make their dumplings from scratch and have a pretty big menu.  I do have to admit their Biang Biang noodles and their dumplings are not the best I had. However, they are cheaper than other places around Spadina. What I did not enjoy was one of the owner/cook was clearing his throat alot during the time I was there which was very gross because you hope he did not spit on your food. Really, clearing your throat should be done in the privacy of your own home and not your business where they are customers.  The owners are nice but they are more friendly to Chinese speaking customers because they can communicate with them. If you cannot speak Chinese they will serve you but you will be ignored most of the time.",1
"[FOOD] - 3.5/5 I was highly anticipating my lunch here since I rarely find authentic Xian restaurants (Northwestern Chinese cuisine) in Toronto. I ordered Xian dishes such as the Steamed Lamb Pita Soup, the Chinese burger (Stuffed Pita), and the Northwestern Cold Noodles. My favourite item was the pita soup. The broth was just rich and flavourful... it would go great on a cold winter day. The cold noodles were a super refreshing part of the meal. Lastly, the Chinese burger (with lamb filling) was pretty good as well. The outer bun was crispy, not too thick, and quite delicious.   [SERVICE] - 4/5 Okay, so I only gave 4/5 because my boyfriend speaks Chinese and the lady also speaks Chinese. She was quite nice and accommodating. It would've been nice if they had more than one server and spoke English. My boyfriend had to translate for the table of 14 next to us who could hardly understand the server.   [OVERALL] - 3/5 While the restaurant can seem demeaning and unfriendly to non-Chinese speakers, it is a great place to go for highly authentic Xian cuisine.",1
"I was in Toronto on March 23, 2019 and it was a cold day. Everyone said, this winter has been very cold and doesn't get warm as usual. I was walking around in Chinatown with one purpose only.....eating Xi'an noodles here. Xi'an cuisine is not easy to find where I live, Orange County, CA. If I drive 20 miles or more, there is one. Other than that, I don't see much. Having Xi'an noodles has been my list to do when I came to Toronto. I finally found one here. The rating wasn't that high, but what can I say? I tried Lam noodles....yes, it was what I needed in the cold weather. So hearty, so warm and thick/wide noodles were perfect! The lady in the restaurant didn't speak much English (I thought), but I was able to order since she gives you a paper and pen. Clever!",2
"Warm service, generous as hell portions. Very tasty cold noodles aka Liang Pi, highly recommended!",2
"If you only speak English you may feel a bit disoriented here, but the staff are very friendly. The food came in good time, and was a great portion. I got the chicken fried noodles, which were full of flavor. Very impressed and would recommend to anyone who loves noodles.",2
Super friendly and honest staff. Good food and prices are super cheap. A great place for a casual and relaxing meal! 11/10,2
"This is yet another restaurant in Chinatown which specializes in homemade dumplings and Northern Chinese cuisine.   I came here only because Yummy Dumplings was closed for lunch on Wednesday, so I ended up here to satisfy my dumpling cravings.   I ordered the pork & chives dumplings (boiled) which was so so. The skin was thicker than I'm used to but still acceptable & you get 16 dumplings for $7.99. The XLB soup dumplings came next. It was presented in the usual bamboo steamer and you get 10 small bite size pieces. It certainly wasn't my favourite because the skin was thick & some seemed under cooked. The pork filling was okay but the soup content wasn't very consistent. Some were not replete with soup when biting into them and overall wasn't very satisfying. Also it's typically served with some fresh ginger on the side to make your dipping sauce but they don't here. Maybe their Xian style dishes are what they are best known for but it certainly wasn't the dumplings.",0
"When we arrived the restaurant was empty and silent. We were seated at a table that was sticky and bits of food left on the table. We ordered the Chinese burgers, pork soup dumplings and cold noodles. The buns were stale, the noodles were excessively greasy and had a weird texture, and the pork dumpling meat was fatty. After leaving the restaurant, both my girlfriend and I felt very uneasy, she threw up immediately. I originally decided to come to this restaurant based on the reviews but after my experience I would not recommend this to anyone.",0
"We picked this restaurant without checking Yelp. Given the current rating, we wouldn't have come in. We are pleasantly surprised by their handmade boiled dumplings (pork and chives filling and pork and fennel filling). Both are tasty and authentic. We also have three other dishes. All good.",2
"Really good Northern Chinese restaurant. Came here with 2 friends and got the Lamb Pao Mo, Lamb noodles, and Beef Noodle Soup. They were all super filling, the noodles were handmade and really chewy. I would definitely come here again.",2
"I am giving them five stars because I know how hard they work everyday and they produce good authentic Chinese food.  The service quality might upset some people, but it won't be too bad. The owners are very friendly, so make sure to choose the lamb peta",2
Really disappointed. We ordered two dishes and wait like an hour for the fish. Maybe it is because we did not order the right thing. But generally i would not go there again.,0
"Better than din tai fung xlb. Very flavorful, you won't even need the vinegar dipping sauce.",2
"I was always a bit skeptical when it came to chain Chinese restaurants, but Asian Legend proved me wrong. Unlike many other North American Chinese restaurants that serve greasy, oily, and overly salty food, Asian Legend's dishes are lighter, less oily, and yet they still pack in flavours. The ambience inside is clean, nice, and I like how they give you paper to write down your orders yourself (like in some dim sum places). Portion sizes are just right, and customer service is quite good.  Asian Legend specializes in northern-style Chinese cuisine, with all-day dim sum that includes xiao long bao and other steamed dumplings. The dim sum menu isn't as large as those in other dim sum places, but their dishes are of high quality. Review of some of the items that I've tried:  - Steamed Vegetarian Dumplings: Come in 6 large pieces in a bamboo basket; filled with minced greens and mushrooms - very flavourful.  - Assorted Seafood with Sizzling (Crispy) Rice: They ask if you want the seafood & vegs with sauce to be poured over the crispy rice or not (some people prefer the crispy rice to stay crispy). Delicious dish - the assorted seafood includes shrimps, scallops, calamari, with assorted vegetables (broccoli, carrot, snap peas, shiitake mushrooms).  - Snow Pea Shoots with Garlic: Standard but awesome accompaniment to the other dishes.  - Fried Rice with Diced Fish, Ginger, and Egg White: This caught me by surprise (in a good way) because it's not as oily or greasy as the fried rice in many other Chinese restaurants. It's light, tastes ""healthy"", with a good amount of diced fish, egg whites, small ginger slices, and some vegs.",2
"This is a really great place for authentic Chinese food! I've ordered a variety of their foods, from xiao long bao to hot and sour soup to Peking duck. All of it is delicious, it's not the best Chinese food I've ever had but it's pretty darn good and hits the spot.  The atmosphere is great, clean and modern. It looks like a high-end restaurant, but the prices are very reasonable!  Service is generally good, but it kind of depends on the day. That's the only reason I'm holding back from 5 stars.",2
"Since living in LA and having a chance to go to Din Tai Fung whenever I wanted, it makes it really hard to think anywhere else could be better. This place was authentic and tastes like bistro dim sum. We got the soup dumplings, shrimp steamed dumplings, and scallion beef rolls.",1
"What a serious gem. Came here on a David Chang recommendation and was definitely not disappointed.  Being met with the same apathy and authenticity as any of the best Chinese restaurants in nyc along with only Asian people eating in the dinning room I knew it was legit. We got some dim sum, pork dumplings, xio long bao soup dumplings, Baby bok choy, shrimp things (pictured) and a seafood fried rice. So full. So cheap. They have beer and teas. Everything we had we spent like $60? Maybe less. Including beer and tip. Highly reccomend.",2
"For some reason you expect good Chinese food to only be served at ugly restaurants. But not this place. It's modern, clean and still serves rather incredible food. Dim sum, seafood, large dishes etc. The only down side to this place is that they have a limited dim sum menu and there are no old ladies to push the food around in carts.  Everything on the menu is super delicious. They have large party rooms and can easily seat groups of 8-10 in their main area as well. Highly recommend.",2
"Everything was outstanding. Come with a big group and get a private room and try everything. Loved the Dan dan noodles, snow pea shoots, both mushroom dishes, fried tofu. Prices were very reasonable. They were nice about splitting the checks.",2
"Not bad but quality control should be supervised.  We order probably once a month and food quality is a hit or miss.  Like today, broccoli was old.   Some time the beef noodles, the beef is tough.",1
"Tucked away into the many food places of China town in Toronto is this place, asian legend. Bruh lemme tell you, this restaurant is legendary, primarily because of the soup dumplings. I've never had them before but was told to go here by a friend. It can be difficult to spot walking down the street so I'm not sure how people would know to go here without being told beforehand.   Come here for the xiaolongbao(soup dumplings) trust me. Are you stupid? Are you duuumb? They're best fresh and with a little bit of the vinegar they provide. Really good flavour, overall A+.",2
"Great variety of Chinese and Taiwanese dishes, pretty good portions. No need to worry about ordering here if you're not comfortable with Mandarin/Cantonese/English- you're given a paper to write down the corresponding numbers of the items you want from the menu. Waitresses were polite and efficient.   FOOD: I recommend the cold jellyfish salad and any of their vegetables. Hot and sour fish was decent but over-seasoned for our taste. Shrimp dumplings were nicely flavored but skin was too thick and chewy.   DRINKS: Tea is some of the best we've had at Chinatown restaurants! I also loved their homemade plum juice (秘製烏梅湯).",2
"We had a team member who was leaving work to pursue his dream job and we took him out for lunch. This place was suggested and quickly liked by a few.     The restaurant managers/owners generally I think underestimate the power of mentioning a bit more details on the menu or at least a server who is knowledgeable about ingredients. In the absence of information I went the safest route of ordering a plain congee and a steamed bun. My order would easily have been more than double if the right information was provided.   So on the limited items that I could have, my review is not a review per se. One cannot mess up a Congee and a bun.  However the food did not arrive all together and out of respect for others, all of us had to wait. Which resulted in food going cold.   The congee and bun were as good as they can be",1
Been to other locations and this one was good for service and being in the heart of Chinatown..we see seeking solace in a familiar menu.  food was tasty but a little heavy with the white pepper with the beef and egg white soup dish.  dishes came out quickly and were large and shareable as always.  snowpea leaves were very tender and young..not woody at all. pricey for Chinese food in Chinatown but well worth it.  not stroller friendly but thankfully good Samaritans came to the rescue!,2
"Without question the worst cashew nut chicken I ever unfortunately ordered... Smaller than most restaurants portions, to top it off; $18.01 for garbage food. There are many WRONGS in this world; a bad meal is pretty low in the grand scheme of things/life.  BUT; a garbage meal is still a garbage meal.  Staff looked miserable, absolutely unpleasant.  I don't need an ass-kissing or TLC at a fast food Chinese restaurant, this was depressing.  Waste of money, waste of time.",0
"Pros: Great soup dumplings! Stand out crispy squid and cold middle dishes. A real stand out from the Cantonese places on the strip and a very different style being North Eastern Chinese Cuisine. This spot may unseat my old standard ""House of Gourmet""  Cons: Service was a little scattered and we had wrong dishes delivered to us and had to ask for sauces.   Recommended. Go for soup dumplings and die happy!",2
"We ordered takeout. It was exceptional. If you're into Sichuan cuisine, this iteration of Mapo Tofu will not let you down. It's spicy, oily, meaty, and absolutely delicious. One thing that surprised us was the soup dumplings. As Xiao long bao connoisseurs, we were expecting a mess of exploded dumplings. However, they came all perfectly intact, still warm and full of soup. While it wasn't as good as fresh (obviously), they were pretty damn good, and were well worth the cost. The baos were less exciting. They were not juicy, and the bun itself tasted off - the texture was strange and not crispy enough.   All in all, a great choice for authentic Chinese takeout. Will be ordering here for the rest of our lives.",2
"Went there with my husband on a Saturday night, and noticed that they don't have many tables for 2-4 people. So you basically have to wait until a table is available. They do have seats on 2 levels.  The Chinese food was average, nothing special. It's a little bit over priced compared to the other Chinese restaurants that's in the area.",1
"We ordered three items: number 1, 15 and 18. The soy bean milk is so bland, but the other two are pretty good. I like the environment. Serving time is ok. However, no WiFi available. Cash only for 10 dollars or below. Lots of items on the menu.",2
"This was our first Chinatown experience and it left much to be desired. I'll start by saying that the menu is extensive, with over 160 items to choose from. Perhaps we didn't order the best dishes.  We ordered the soup dumplings with crab meat and pork, which were the highlight of the night. Both the Sui Mai and the chicken and cabbage potsticker, which were on special, did not hit home. They were both bland and could have used some salt. The last dish, stir fried Ho Fun with beef was good but the beef had an interesting texture, it had no chew and fell apart in your mouth. I'd say the noodles had good flavour but could have been better.  To sum up, the food was good. It wasn't great, it wasn't bad... it was good. The service was great. Food came quickly and servers were always nearby. If I do come back to this location, the soup dumplings are the only thing that I will be ordering again.",1
"Food was ok nothing special.  The taste was more blend i don't know i thought after reading the reviews it will be a good place but I didn't like the food flavors.  We ordered a lot of food. After waiting so long that someone's gonna pick up our order. To this counts noodle with beef, crispy fried noodles, veggies and dumplings and beef pancake. Actually I liked the beef pancake and the dumplings. When we were finished we ordered the bill.  A lady came with the takeout boxes and then the drama starts I don't know the lady was packing the food and she throws angry the empty plate on the table.  She got so upset first I thought I gave here to less tip and then I was like no it can't be.  So she was so angry she went to the other waiters and keep on pointing to our table and she was like angry like no tomorrow.  I was literally shocked what happen to her.   Trying to ask but well she didn't speak English. So I ignored them all of them.  I don't know maybe she got mad that I couldn't finish my food. So my advice for this place is nothing special. If you want some waiter getting angry at you for no reason sure go ahead. This place is not recommended from my side.",0
This place was AMAZING. We ordered a ton of items on the menu and everything is delicious. We all highly recommend this Chinese restaurant. Yum!,2
"Been getting our Chinese BBQ takeout here for years. Great BBQ duck, chicken and Cha Siu BBQ pork.",2
Social distancing is in effect.  If I remember correctly you can't go inside the shop without wearing a mask.  People were lining up patiently today near 4:30 this afternoon.  The roast pork all gone.  Grabbed a duck.,2
"The barbecue meat here is really good, juicy and tender. I normally get the lunch boxes here, and it's very hit and miss here. I made the mistake of coming here 1.5 hours before they closed. They ran out of veggies, but still had plenty of meat left.  If you get the young dude cutting your meat, you're gonna get much less meat in your box. he's pretty stingy. and I've gone here 3 times, and every time he cut my meat, I got either bad cuts, or very little.  I've gotten roasted duck rice before, and he gives you the bones and rib area, with one piece of breast so you have one piece with meat.  Today I got 2 boxes, No veggies were left. I got 6 pieces of bbq pork and 5 pieces of roasted pork. and whole box load of rice. was so disappointed! barely any toppings, and they had plenty of meat left!! not like they were running out.  argh! the only part I can't complain is it's 6.50 a box and comes with either soup or a can of pop.  Pro tip, come early, otherwise don't come. and hope it's not the young dude cutting your meat.",1
"Found this on Yelp and picked it cause it had a higher rating than the other shops all lined up serving the same thing!  There were only a few people in line for Ho Ho, but there was a line out the door a few shops down. Probably should've gone to the other place, but this one was ok.  Pork was ok. The skin was still crispy when we got back to the hotel. Duck wasn't anything special. Cha siu was ok. This w all about average for us, although I know our moms would say it wasn't good.  Next time, I'll have to try the other place with the longer line.",1
"Would give 3.5 overall, but closer to 4 than 3.  Prices are unbeatable as you really cant get any cheaper than 10 dollars half a roasted duck! Service is quick. Fresh meats provided and the roast on their duck is pretty decent, although I prefer it to be a little more roasted in general, but if you prefer your roasted duck to be on the slightly crispy and juicy rather than a bigger crunch with darker skin, this will definitely be a good place to start.  Also got the pork loin drumsticks (not sure exactly what it is in English) and those were just ok. I probably wouldn't order it again as the price for 3 was equivalent to the half duck!   Rice with one meat is also only a price of $5. Cheap eats cant get any better than this.",2
I was disappointed with this place for the price they charge their portion is so small I got the duck with rice barely any duck a bunch of cheapscapes the duck was okay honestly the duck at congee Queen was better price and way better taste last time I'm coming here,0
"Small, cold (in the winter!), drabby looking, and to be honest, a little pricier than average... And yet there's a good reason they feature a line up every time: amazing Chinese barbeque style meat.  What We Got: roast pork, duck wings and duck feet What We Liked: all of it. What We Didn't: the lack of heat during long winter line ups...! What We'll Get Next: they've got curry beef brisket for $10 and I have to try that. Plus more roast pork. Also got some solid lunch specials.  YOU SHOULD BRING A FRIEND WHO SPEAKS CANTONESE OR READS CHINESE. Tucked away on the southeast side of Midland and Mcnicoll, it's easy to miss. And when you get into the plaza, it's also easy to miss because it's rather  unadorned, and sits next to another Chinese barbeque spot.  Anyway, once you get in.... this is the ultimate NO DECOR, NO FANCY STUFF, NO FRILLS (actually moreso than the grocery store), OG style Chinese barbeque place.  All the signs are in Chinese and they're taped up in random places. They ain't here to look pretty. There will probably be a line up of grannies and grampies and uncles and aunties... And that's when you know the people KNOW. This is good barbeque.  Fast and efficient service.  Cuts of meat were soooo crunchy, tender, delicious.  SOURCE OF MY NEW CRAVINGS.  I'LL BE BACK.",2
"Let me update my most recent experience under the new ownership.    I just had a way better experience here than the last time I came which should be noted.  The bbq pork and roast pork were very moist, full of flavour, and the portion was good.  For $7.50, I'd much rather get a lunchbox here, than... ahem... the neighbouring joints.  I like the soup here too.    Service was quick.  They're back in my good books!",2
"Taste: Amazing and authentic. Definitely 5/5 on this. I mostly order bbq pork but sometimes I'll get the roasted pork. Bbq pork has a sweet savory taste to it, while the roasted pork has a crunchy skin with a soft meat to go with it. If you're sensitive to the sauces and tastes of authentic Chinese cuisine, I suggest ordering the roasted pork instead (and try a friend's bbq pork first before committing to it).  Price: Also 5/5. Cheap - what more do you want?  Service: My experinces, despite my lack of Chinese, has been very friendly with the workers. Yeah, the interior sucks but you're literally just there to order and get out so I don't see much of an issue. Though, it is quite unclean considering they serve food.  Portion: Now this is where my 4 star rating comes from. I agree with the other reviewers that they're cheap and the portions are quite filling. However, their MEAT portions are ridiculously inconsitent. Rice is just a filler to make you feel like there's a lot but you're not going there to pay for rice. As indicated by my picture, that day was a great day. Super filled with meat. On bad days it was maybe half of that or even less because they spread it around to make it look bigger.   In conclusion: Great authentic Chinese bbq for the price and portion OF RICE, but expect inconsistencies with the meat portion. Don't expect to come here to dine and have a nice flashy interior. Go somewhere else to eat. CASH ONLY.",2
"This place was ok. We tried the roasted duck, roasted pork, and bbq pork, and pork tongue. Taste was average. Duck was very hard to bite through. Meats were cut sloppily and some barely cut. Floor was sticky. With so many better options around, probably won't try again.",1
"This place had given us so much food and it comes with a drink too.  BBQ Pork, Roast Pork ( Crispy Pork), Soya Chicken and Roast duck. Pick any meat of a bed of white rice and blanched Chinese vegetables. Yum, right?  YES!  We had a little hard time communicating since my Chinese was so rusty but thanks to previous yelp pics, we were able to get what we wanted. The employees had great customer service as well.Even though, the store opens at 11am, they open at 10:30am and we saw some lines already.   We got the lunches or platters and it came with a drink for CAD 6.50 per box. My husband and I looked at each other and we were like, that couldn't be right! We saw how much food we were getting and also the drinks too!! No way, but yes we did..  Great customer service+ ample & tasty food+ Affordability= One Very Happy Customer    Tip: Cash Only and there's barely any place in there to sit down and eat. What we did, we got the food and went to a park to eat. :D",2
"Ordered a whole roast duck. One of the worker says to me that he had to cut the duck inside the kitchen. While I came home and opened the take out boxes, one of the box was full but the other box was half full and there were a lot of ducks's necks to replace the empty space. I have assumed they stole some of the goods part of the duck for their combo rice meal and they make $$$ out of that. No wonder that they had to cut the duck inside the kitchen so that you can not see what they are stealing. I had call my friends and they say the same thing.  The duck was good and you can taste the freshness and was not frozen but you lost me as a customer for life. The reasons why I brought the roast duck from them at that time because the other two Chinese roast meat place in the same area was closed due to Covid 19 and they was the only place open for Chinese roast meat. Words of month travel very fast and your business will suffer because of this unethical practice. Now I know how they are able to sell the rice combo meals so cheap. Buyers Beware.",0
"Quick lunch today while trying to kill some time. I don't know why I've been craving BBQ pork lately, I'm assuming this is what pregnant women go through. I yelped this spot and was thrilled it had 4.5 stars. This place is takeout only, there is no room to barely stand inside. Plan on eating in your car or sneaking a table in the food court.  You better not stutter when ordering because the cashier is all about fast efficient ordering.   I'm giving a one star penalty because they don't offer duck in any of the combos. They only offer half duck minimum orders.  I was super bummed. I ended up ordering BBQ pork and soy sauce chicken with an absurd amount of green onions sauce. It sure hit the spot.  I was super jealous of my brother's roast pork order.  The skin was perfect. 10/10. The meat was so moist. For sure next time I'm going to order that.",2
"FOOD: 2.5 stars PRICE: 4 stars SERVICE: 4 stars  I came here after reading many good reviews about how tasty their food was.  I looked for something to grab it home after picking up my adorable macarons at DaanGo Cake lab.   We ordered 3 boxes of meat on rice; one with roasted pork, another one was roasted duck and the last one was bbq pork.  It comes with either tofu or vegetable on the side.  We only chose vegetable because my husband isn't a fan of tofu. You can also choose to have either a drink or soup along with your meal too.  The price for bbq meat on rice is around $6.50-$8.50.  Isn't it a good deal?  The staff was very nice and friendly.  I wasn't sure if they were the owners or not. I really couldn't tell.  I don't live in the area and it was my first time here.   The portion was generous however the meat was quite dry.  The bbq pork was ok.  It was better than the roasted pork and roasted duck.  The roasted pork wasn't crispy as I expected and there was little meat on the roasted duck.    As all above, the food I ordered was mediocre or maybe it wasn't my day.  Anyway, the price was good.  Three meals were only $22.50!  It's pretty good right!?",1
"This place is pretty much the epitome of ""hole in the wall."" Tucked into a little strip mall, the restaurant is unassuming from the outside and tiny on the inside. There are no dine-in options - it's take-out only.  When you walk inside, you'll be able to see all the roast meats hanging and spinning. If the doors to the back room are open, you can even see the chefs chopping up the raw meat just two meters away. At the counter, you can see some of the side dishes on display, to help you decide what to order.  The menu has a variety of options, including duck, pork, and chicken, as well as sides such as vegetables and rice. I ended up getting the roast duck with steamed bok choy on the side. The roast duck was delicious - though quite messy to eat, due to all of the juices and bones. The steamed bok choy was lackluster.  The food was tasty and the tiny half restaurant / half butcher shop was quite an experience. It's worth a stop if you're craving some meat and aren't afraid of the grittier environment.",1
"This place was good, I thought it wasn't good because 2 doors down they had a massive lineup.  Luckily for me I tried both. There was no competition on who's food was better.....  For $6.50 a box with 2 meats here is so worth it. The only reason why the neighbors had a huge line was because it was $5 a box. (they can keep their food NOT WORTH IT!)  I had roasted pork and bbq pork..... The roasted was so crispy and moist and the bbq pork was moist not dry at all. Totally worth the extra $1.50",2
This place is great! Super cheap and huge portions. A $7.5 lunch box combo will easily last me 2 meals. Taste good too but I'm not picky and don't have much to compare to. Was a little worried about ordering since I don't speak Cantonese but it was no problem. Overall very nice! Will definitely be back. Only wish is for more veggies,2
"I get lunch from here quite a bit, and I usually the bbq pork and duck combo. It's one of the best deals and you get a really good portions. They also give you soup and/or a drink if you want. The quality is pretty good even though the place might look a bit divey.",2
"I went on a Friday late afternoon, and the staffs were eating. They quickly greeted me and got up to ask what I wanted to get. It was a surprisingly awesome experience at this small Chinese bbq shop!  I order 2 items combo rice of roasted pork and bbq pork, as well as half a duck and it came out to be a little over $20 including tax. What a steal for the quality and portion! While I was waiting, one of the staff offered me to sample their bbq pork..what great service!  I wish I lived close by and I'll definitely patron more often!",2
"Pros: Awesome prices Honest service  Cons: Cash only  I think I may have found my new favourtie Chinese BBQ place.  Again, I have Yelp to thank for this find because you would never find this place otherwise.  Ho Ho Barbeque doesn't face the street so it can be tough to find if you're looking for it in particular.  This place is the definition of a hidden gem.  It's a small place nestled in a plaza at Midland and McNicoll.  The place is super tiny, just enough to fit everything in.  There's 2 chairs and a aisle to sit if you really want, but take out is the way to go.  What stands out immediately is the prices.  Most places now charge close to $10 or more for a pound of BBQ pork.  The price here, $7.50.  You're not comprising quality here for the price too.  The meats here are just as good as anywhere else.  You'll find the prices are about 2 to 3 dollars cheaper across the board for everything you usually find at a Chinese BBQ place.  2 things stand out for me the most here.  First, they have a curry beef brisket.  It's hard to find Chinese BBQ places that to curry beef brisket anymore.  It used to be more frequent but most places have stopped doing it.  You get a large order here for $8.50, that's a win.    Second, the service her is amazing.  I usually get my BBQ pork a little on the fatty side.  When I placed my order, the butcher took a look and couldn't find any.  Rather than try to sell me something I didn't want and pretend it was still fatty, he honestly told me he didn't have any and asked if I wanted to wait 10 minutes for some new ones that would be fatty.  Let me tell you, most places would not do that.  They would of just chose something remotely close to what I wanted and that would be that.  The fact that he was so honest about what he's selling impressed the heck out of me.  The only thing bad I can say about this place is the cash only policy but that's nothing new for these kind of places.  I love Ho Ho Barbeque.  Like I said, it's my new go to for Chinese BBQ and any fan should definitely try this place out as well.",2
"One of my favourite places to get noodles!!  I came here for the first time a couple of months ago and i remembered i ordered the biang biang mian and it was absolutely delish! The first time i came, the place was pretty crowded because it was a Friday night but everything, from food quality to service, was still decent.  I came back a couple of days ago. I'm trying to reduce meat consumption as much as possible and I was soooo glad to see the amount of vegetarian/vegan options they have!! I tried the vegan kudai mian and it was delightful - loved the flavour and the texture of the noodles! Also tried some side dishes: okra cauliflower, tofu sheet, and bon bon chicken. The okra cauliflower was AMAZING. The okra was cooked nicely and the whole dish had a really nice citrus-y taste, 10/10 would recommend! The tofu sheet and the bon bon chicken were served with some peanut sauce which was superrrr tasty. I also tried some of my sister's dan dan mian and i'd say that i prefer the texture of the wide noodles.  Would say the only downside to this place is how small it is and how it's super crowded during weekend dinners.",2
"Amazing noodle shop!  Seating is a bit tight, so not the best winter spot with jackets, but there are some little storage spots found all around. Their decor, on the other had, is on point--and so is their food! I think pretty much anything here is a winner in my book.   We got the wok cumin che mian, yopo biang biang mian, pork jia mo, spicy stewed beef noodle, and liang pi. The wok cumin che mian is a nice spiced and savory side dish. It could realistically be considered a small meal if you ate it by itself.  The yopo biang biang mian has a bit of everything. It has a sweet and savory taste and plenty of toppings for the noodles! I love how they really don't skimp out on the toppings, which likely consists of half the dish! Their noodles are also wonderfully springy.  The pork jia mo was absolutely stuffed with filing and was delicious! Really great simple item if you're on the go.  The spicy stewed beef noodle was very nice. The beef fell apart and the broth was savory. It's not a very stand-out dish at this place, as it closely resembles a lot of Chinese beef noodle soup offerings at restaurants--but it's tasty nonetheless.  Their liang pi is very peanuty and not very spicy, despite what it looks like (at least in my opinion). It reminds me of Thai or Vietnamese style foods and is very refreshing!   This is an absolutely amazing restaurant for super delicious noodle dishes and at a pretty fair price points, considering the location and quality! They have quite a variety of noodle dishes, so there's something for everyone. Would highly recommend coming here at least once!",2
"3.5/5   Came here for a quick lunch since I heard a lot about the Yonge and finch location of this noodle spot. We were quickly sat down and  able to place our order.   We both got the Biang Biang Mien since it was recommended by the waitress and seemed to be the most popular item from others who came to this place.   The noodles were interesting given the variety of different toppings that you wouldn't necessarily think go together, but I liked the mixed noodles concept. My biggest issue was that despite there being so many different toppings, the noodles tastes bland and didn't have much flavour to them. It seemed like the toppings weren't cooked enough to bring out the flavours or salted enough to help.   Overall an interesting noodle concept but I don't think I'd return again.",1
"Pros: Well done hand pulled noodles Nice variety on menu  Cons: Seating is tight  Artisan has been in the North York area for quite a while.  This place is there venture into the downtown core.  This much larger location is welcome addition to the downtown area.  Fans of hand pulled noodles should give this place a try.  As I mentioned earlier, this location is much larger than it's North York counterpart.  However, being downtown, it is subject to some limitations as well.  As with many downtown restaurant locations, I feel the seating is tight.  It's a veritable obstacle course when the place is full and everyone has their stuff with them.  The seats here are all of the stool variety as well.  There's a little slot for some space to put your things.  But with most people, you will not have anything to hang your jackets, bags etc on which means you probably place it nearby on the floor which adds to the obstacle course.  I was actually impressed by the menu here.  They have a good assortment of noodles to choose from here.  Some of them seem like original creations that you can't just find anywhere else.  I settled on the classic braised beef noodle and my wife got the clam mashi.    As you can see from my pics, the presentation on their dishes here are spot on.  Every dish that came out from the kitchen looked very good.  I have to be honest, when my bowl of noodles came out I thought I was going to have to eat something else after.  The bowl was on the smaller side for beef noodles.  However, they do pack a good amount of noodles in there. It should be more than enough for normal appetites.  Big eaters like I am should definitely consider the extra noodle options.  Taste wise, the beef noodle was on point.  The broth was nice and not overly salty.  Noodles were pretty good with some bite.  They weren't the best noodles I've ever had, but they were very good in their own way.  The beef was tender and at least stewed for quite a bit before being served.  All in all, great bowl of noodles.  My wife's dish felt more like an Italian pasta dish.  If it wasn't for the spiciness and the wood ear mushrooms, you could easily serve it at an Italian restaurant and nobody would bat en eye.  Even the noodles looked like gnocchi!  Service was great overall during our visit.  A little disappointment that they only accept cash and debit.  Overall, this is a great little place to try our if you're a fan of hand pulled noodles.  There definitely some of other dishes I saw that I would like to try next time I'm here.",2
"What did I just eat? lol I tried their Famous YoPo Biang Biang Mian. It's a random mix of everything. It has a lot of vegetables (potato, mushrooms, carrots, zucchini, egg & tomato) if you want a healthier option. For me, it's not a lot of meat, a smaller portion and not very filling. The hand pulled noodles were good, the right texture, but again not enough quantity.",1
"Tight seating area with not much space between tables, nor to put winter parkas. My friend's seat was more like a plastic stool. Not comfy at all. More of a eat and run place but your tummy might be hungry still.   The service was good. We got three water refills from the bottle as it was small.   My dish came out messy and the portion for $14 was small. There aren't enough veggies. The spicy taste was a good quick to it. The noodle looked like gnocchi and it was chewy. My friend's dish came later on as they messed up the order. She said it was ok. Again, one is paying the price for a small portion of food that wouldn't fill up one's stomach   So definitely I was still hungry before heading to the theatre.   Verdict- not sure where they are getting the high reviews but it's not worth my time. For $14 plus taxes and tips, I'll rather eat at a food court that would satisfy this Cat-Squirrel's tummy. Bring on the food!!",0
"Yum! I've been searching for a place that satisfy my cravings for nice, thick... biang biang noodles!! Great value and taste that's all you need, you gotta eat here.  It's just so inconvenient to make these Xi'an hand pulled noodles at home and hard to find a place in Toronto that delivers thick noodles in the right texture and comforting flavours. Tomato and egg and eggplant is not something you typically find with noodle dishes and just love the tomato/egg as it's a staple comfort food in Chinese cuisine.   This place has it all in terms of what I look for in a good noodle joint, hand pulled, great flavors, GREAT value and complimentary ingredients. They don't skimp out the veggies or give bad cuts of meat like some places do. Love the pork belly.   I tried the biang biang and beef rib soup noodle. I say the biang biang is a must try when you first come. Beef rib soup noodle is just not as good.  I also try Liang pi combo, so odd that it comes with specifically orange soda. Is orange soda the best complimentary drink? The meat bun, orange soda and cold noodles all together is only $11~. What a bargain!  Quickly added to my favs!",2
"Another month has come and gone and here we are in the heart of Toronto just doing our thing. We've walked by Artisan Plus many time and we finally gave it a try. This place was buzzing with people around the lunch hour however the wait for a table for two wasn't very long. We waited may be 5 mins.  As this was our first visit we wanted to try a few of the appetizers and different noodles dishes. As such for the apps, we ordered the Artisan Pork Jia Mo which is handcraft artisan bread with chopped braised pork belly and gravy. The braised pork belly was quite tasty however it did get quite messy because of the gravy. We also tried the Shuan Tofu Sheet which was made of fresh tofu sheet mixed with bean sprouts, shredded red pepper, scallion, gourmet chilli, peanut and sesame sauce. This dish had the very slightest numbing spice. However this dish was slightly on the oily side and the tofu sheet were too long.  For our mains, I tried the Famous Yo Po Biang Mian which was ribbon noodle, sauteed tomato, scramble egg, cauliflower, potato, carrot, organic cloud ear mushroom, edamame, grilled zucchini, paparika, and vinegrette. The ribbon noodle was super long which made eating the noodle slightly difficult. However the flavours were different and interesting. Nothing that really made my taste buds dance. There was no numbing spice to this dish. However if you don't eat spicy on a regular basis I wouldn't recommend this dish. My husband tried the Wok Cumin Che Mian with Spring Lamb. Surprisingly the Lamb wasn't super gamey. Again the noodles were all super long and the flavour was okay. However, I still want to try their noodle soup one day.   The service was on the ball. The waitress was always around in case you needed them. Than again the restaurant wasn't super large. There were probably around 40 seats.",1
"So much hype we had to stop by and try it out. This place is newish to me located near Dundas and Bay and I've seen it being renovated months ago and thought the interior was really hip and modern looking. This is a noodle place that serves Northern Chinese style, the menu is very simple and don't have too many different things clouding your mind on what to eat.   We ordered the Artisan Pork Jia Mo, and Shuan Tofu Sheet for starters. The pork Jia Mo is chopped braised pork belly with gravy served in a handcrafted artisan bread, this was not bad but flavour was slightly weak in my opinion. The tofu sheets are made from fresh sheets, this dish is served cold and almost like a salad with shredded peppers, bean sprouts, scallions, chilli, chilli oil, Sichuan pepper corns, and sesame oil. I found that the flavour is good not too much numbing spice and not too spicy but boy it did have tons of oil.   For mains we ordered their Famous YoPo Biang Mian and the Wok Cumin Che Mian with Spring Lamb. the Biang mian has a lot going on with sauteed tomato, scrambled eggs, cauliflower, potato, carrot, woodear mushrooms, zucchini, edamame beans, paprika, and vinaigrette sitting under all these ingredients are some ribbon noodles which were slightly too long. I thought that this dish was a mixed with way too many things and the flavour got lost way too busy. The Wok Cumin Che Mian with Spring Lamb was better and the lamb wasn't gamy but I wish there was more slices of lamb. This dish I found was a little small for the price.   Service was great our server was very knowledgeable about their product. She kept our water carafe topped with water. The food comes out very quick and displayed nicely. When it came time to pay the bill was ready and the server came with a debit machine as well. Be prepared to bring cash with you as this place is cash or debit only.  I will be back to try some soup noodles next time. Hopefully it will change my mind and get a better rating.",1
"Finally got the chance to try Artisan Plus and it was just as amazing as an expected! First of all the interior is very clean and aesthetically pleasing and the staff are super friendly!   We ordered the Yo po biang biang noodles and pork jiamo. I was surprised by how many different vegetables (such as the zucchini, the wood was mushroom, potatoes, carrots and the tomatoes and eggs) are in the noodles and how well they complemented each other! The noodles were chewy and really absorbed the flavour well since they were thoroughly coated with the spicy oil. The only complaint I had was that the potatoes were hard/not as well-cooked but that might just be personal preference. The pork jiamo was actually stuffed and very filling - they don't skimp on the meat stuffing - and it was super juicy.  The only caveat was that this restaurant only takes cash or debit so make sure you come ready!   Will definitely be back soon!",2
"Artisan Plus received a great amount of hype upon opening on IG and I've been waiting to try it since.  AMBIANCE: 5/5 The store itself is small but functional. The seating is very well designed with ample room in between each table and each chair has it's own cubby to leave purses/shopping bags in. The decoration itself gives the restaurant a really nice modern, chic vibe and great for IG pics!  FOOD: 3/5 I ordered their famous YoPo Biang Biang Mian with Beef: this comes with scrambled eggs, tomatoes, carrots, zucchini, organic cloud ear mushroom, five spice tofu, edamame, and potato. The dish came with thick ribbon noodles which were THICK, chewy, and filling. The plate was okay but a little underwhelming from how much hype was given. The sauce was a little plain and I was expecting more of a savory flavor. Because there was such a variety I believe they only put a little of each so it makes the dish seem insubstantial.   SERVICE: 5/5 The service is really attentive here. The server was friendly and advised of spice levels of the dish (my friends CANNOT handle spicy). Water was always refilled and the food came out hot and fast. Bills came quickly and easily split.  OVERALL: 3/5 I feel like this was a solid but average experience. I'll be back in the future to try other things on the menu!",1
"Overall, an OK noodle spot. Interesting to try out but not a must-try.   I ordered the Famous YoPo Biang Biang Mian (which the waitress mentioned was their most popular dish) and the Shuan Tofu Sheets:  Biang Biang Mian: The plate is quite large so if you're hungry this is the dish to order. The noodles were pretty tasty/chewy and the beef tasted good but the rest of the plate didn't really stand out and was loaded with vegetables (see picture).  Shuan Tofu Sheets: Again, another OK dish but wasn't amazing. While the flavor is there from the peanut and sesame sauce, the texture of the tofu was off-putting after a few strands. We didn't finish the dish.   If you're looking for spicy noodles, give this restaurant a try. Otherwise, tons more noodle places to eat around Yonge-Dundas.",1
"Relatively new noodle spot that opened up downtown just at Bay and Dundas. Came by with a few coworkers for lunch and the consensus was that it was okay.   Even though Artisan plus was packed when we arrived. We were lucky and was able to get seated fairly quickly for a party of 6.   We were seated on the high top right in front of the kitchen and got to witness the staff in action. It still amazes me how efficient the kitchen works, it's a well oiled machine.   I ordered the appetizer trio, pork bun, and clam mashi. The appetizer trio was a combo of enoki, bean curd, and tripe. Of the 3 the tripe stood out the most. The bean curd and enoki mushroom were okay at best. The trio comes with dipping sauce that tasted very similar to a peanut sauce.   The pork bun was shared among the group and we found that although the pork was really flavourful and moist, the bun itself was a tad on the dry side. Not the good kind either. It's worth a try but I wouldn't be ordering this again if I visited again.   The clam mashi was amazing! I've gotta say I could have done with without the other two items on the menu but the clam mashi is a must. Be warned, it's a little spicy. I would say out of 10, would be about a 7 on my scale. Not to the point where the heat was unbearable and unenjoyable. It definitely lingers and I found myself going through water pretty quickly. The clams were declines in the dish and there was quite a few in there to enjoy. This was my first time having mashi and I'm now a big fan of that.",1
"A solid spot for hand-pulled noodles. I got the wok cumin che mian with beef. There's a lot of well-integrated flavour in the bowl. The noodles have the right texture. Precisely-julienned vegetables are all mixed in so there's a lot going on with each bite. It was labelled spicy but I didn't get a lot of heat.  It's pricey ($16 for what I got) and portions aren't massive, but it sure is tasty.",2
"I have been here twice already after they opened, first time didn't impress me that much, I ordered the spicy biangbiang noodle with pork belly and the pork belly jiamo, they also have spicy oil on the side of u don't think it's spicy enough just ask them to give u the jar. The biangbiang noodle has too much vegetable in it(XD which isn't bad, but I would be much happier if there r more pork), instead of the pork belly which they were claiming on the menu, I think it's more like pulled pork texture, so if u don't like pulled pork texture, go for the beef option. The jiamo is like a bun with lots of meat inside, it's it's very filling I can't even finish it.   Second time here, the line up is equally long, we had 5 people and they are too tiny to fit us, we had to squeeze and it wasn't comfortable. I ordered the clam mashi noodle which is like a Chinese style gnocchi , ITS SOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have never had mashi like this and I'm really impressed!!! I will definitely come back for more of this!!!!!!!!",2
"Tried out this newish place at bay and Dundas. The menu describes the food as northern Chinese and simple. While the ingredients are all fresh, I think they've taken the ""simple"" a bit too far. I tried the short-rib beef dish. The broth is basic and does not have much flavour. That said, the veggies were all fresh and delicious. Just needed a bit more flavour to kick the dish up a notch.   Decor-wise, the place is hip and modern. Staff are all very friendly and can explain the dishes. Food comes out fast. May try this place again and try a different dish",1
"Sooooooo. Good. No joke, I visited this restaurant and came back for more only 2 days later.  I am so glad that regional Chinese cuisine is exploding onto Toronto's food scene. Don't get me wrong, dim sum is alright, but biang biang noodles are where it's at.  And they are so damn good here. Thick handmade noodles, enveloped in warm sweet and savoury sauce, and served with a generous variety of toppings -- it's just so comforting. I inhaled everything on my plate in record time. I think the $13.99 price point is fair.  The other standout for me was the Shuan Platter ($12.99). It's an appetizer sampler with enoki mushrooms, tofu sheets, and honeycomb tripe doused in chili sesame sauce. Just thinking about the tripe makes my mouth water -- the soft, chewy tripe was the perfect vessel for soaking up the rich sauce. Umami galore.  Pretty much everything else we've tried so far has been delicious, except perhaps the shredded potato salad ($5.99, not pictured). It was a little too vinegary and not spicy enough for my taste, but still complemented the Jia Mo well.  The ambiance is definitely fast-paced during busy prime hours, so come during off peak periods (before 6 pm, after 8:30 pm) to skip the lineups. Service is quite good and, unlike similar restaurants, the servers speak fluent English.  Can't get enough of this place! Try it and thank me later.",2
"I highly recommend this restaurant if you want to try North-West Chinese eats that are different from usual westernized Chinese food (aka fried rice, General Tao, etc.)  My first impression was the interior - very bright and modern with transparent glass stools, unlike other typical Chinese restaurants that run on a warm and cozy vibe. Even though the restaurant looked spacious from outside, it was actually quite tight with limited seats.   Since it was our first visit, we opted for the restaurant's bestsellers, which were beef Yopo BiangBiang (wide flat noodles) and Pork JiaMo (pork bun). The noodles arrived quickly after 5 minutes with tomato scrambled egg, braised beef, and assortments of vegetables (cubed potatoes, carrots, ear fungus, edamame, zucchini). At first, I thought the combination of ingredients was peculiar; however, it turned out to be absolutely delicious as different flavors really complimented each other. I also enjoyed their chewy ""ribbon noodles""! If you are not able to handle spicy food like I am, I'd recommend asking the waitress for no (or less) chilli flakes since they really added some intense heat to the dish. The pork JiaMo was good as well - the shredded meat was well-marinated.   We visited a few days after Grand Opening and the restaurant was quite packed. However, service was still quick and efficient.   A bonus point is that Artisan Plus is vegan-friendly!  I'd love to come back to try other different North-Western Chinese food!",2
"The food here was mediocre but the service was absolutely abysmal, to the point where I'm not even considering the food in the rating I'm giving.   The server was extremely rude - I asked for an iced tea (canned drink) upon being seated after a 20 minute wait and the server legit said ""just order your drink when you order everything else"" and walked away, even though it was simply a canned drink that takes 1 minute to take out of the fridge.   When it came time to order our meal, I asked for the drink again, which the server acknowledged. I didn't receive the drink during my whole meal and no one came to check on us so I wasn't able to reorder.   When the bill came, they actually had the audacity to charge us for the drink that I never received, and when we asked them to take it off the bill they didn't come back with the bill for over 15 minutes, and didn't print a receipt for us because their ""machine was broken"".   Honestly I'm not sure if we were charged for it, but a place that would allow their servers to talk to/treat customers like this is definitely not a place that I would recommend to others because it says a lot about the restaurant's values and culture, and the food is definitely not special enough to put up with this kind of service.",0
Great place in the heart of Toronto dt! I recently discovered XiAn food and this restaurant did not disappoint. They made the space quite fun. Their biangbiang noodles were tasty and I loved trying all the toppings with it. Nice punch with the heat.   Would return to try the buns!,2
"Located on the second floor of DoubleTree By Hilton hotel is Lai Wah Heen, a premium dim sum restaurant. The restaurant is clean and elegant with original Chinese calligraphy paintings. I have dined here for dim sum on a few occasions, and have enjoyed it each time. However, most recently, I finally tried their dinner menu. It contains a variety of classic dishes and some more imaginative items. They are also now serving casserole dishes.   Got the Casserole of Lobster, which was a very flavourful dish containing a healthy chunk of lobster, and vermicelli cooked in conpoy chili sauce. The XOXO added a nice spicy kick to it. That was my favorite dish of the night. They also have classic clay pot dishes. I wasn't a fan of the eel one (a little salty), but I enjoyed the chicken and foie gras & minced beef ones. They're priced for four people, so definitely good for friends or family to share.   Since it's upscale, prices are higher than the average Chinese restaurants. So, I think people need to go in with an open mind that the price is not the same as most of the places in Chinatown or Markham. Overall, what I like about Lai Wah Heen is the consistency of the dim sum dishes and creativity (while remaining tasty).",2
"I give this restaurant three stars. I have been to Lai Wah Heen twice, most recently in January.  Lai Wah Heen is a upscale dim sum restaurant located on the second floor of the DoubleTree by Hilton, in downtown Toronto. The restaurant is spacious and bright, the staff is friendly and the service is excellent.  The dim sum is very good but there aren't many, if any vegetable options so it is quite heavy. Also, it doesn't seem very expensive but the price can increase rather quickly when you purchase a few of the higher priced dishes. The bill was higher when my wife and I went here in January than it was when we took our friend last year for her birthday. We particularly liked the crispy shrimp rolls served with sweet hawthorn sauce and the sticky rice filled with assorted seafood & meat, wrapped & steamed in lotus leaf. The spicy, sweet oyster sauce goes really well with the majority of the dim sum and the tea is excellent.  I will likely return to Lai Wah Heen sometime in the near future. I recommend this restaurant to anyone that likes dim sum and wants experience eating it in a high end setting. Three stars.",1
"There's really too many good dim sum places in the GTA so it's really hard to say that this place is phenomenal.  It's located on the 2nd floor of DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel.   I love the ambiance here and it's a great place for a business lunch.  If your office is connected to the PATH, It's really easy to get to; walk towards the Sheraton food court, exit the doors of the Sheraton parking lot that takes you up to City Hall and then its another 5 mins walk.  I've been here many times for dim sum and it is always consistently very good.  A recent reviewer mentioned that the skin was a bit thick on the steamed dumpling.  I have to admit that it was on the chewier side but the shrimp inside was very tasty!  The siu mai and the fried shrimp balls are my favorite!  The dishes are a bit pricey for about $9.50 a dish which makes it even harder to say it's worth it.   But given that there aren't too many dim sum restaurants around the core financial district, I will likely be back.  Besides, everything is expensive downtown.",2
"Came to Lai Wah Heen with my family to try out their peking duck as I had received a coupon for a free order. Growing up in Scarborough and being completely surrounded by Chinese restaurants, and being Chinese myself, I've had my fair share of Chinese cuisine. Upon arrival, I knew right away it would be a different vibe as it was located inside a hotel and everything looked fairly nice.   The staff was helpful and polite though a bit stiff. Nonetheless our order was accurate and the tea was always filled. We had dinner on a Tuesday night so it wasn't overly busy but there were some larger parties dining.  On to the food: so as I said, I'm Chinese and have grown up around eating this food in and outside of the house. We ordered about 9 dishes for 7 people including peking duck, stir-fried beef flavoured with aged mandarin peel, sweet and sour pork w/ lychee, gailon vegetables, pineapple chicken fried rice, soy sauce fried rice noodle with beef and fried chicken. First impressions, the food looked nice but was pretty small portions and cost a pretty penny more than what you get uptown. Not surprising with this being a downtown hotel restaurant. The taste though was really really good. Everything was delicious and had lots of flavour. Presentation was pretty and at the end we ordered enough to feel full though not without a price.   Overall, the food was delicious, the service was good but price for the amount of food was just a bit too much for myself. They are other options out there for upscale Chinese food that might possibly be less expensive and closer to my neck of the woods.",1
"I recently attended a dinner at Lai Wah Heen with 9 others. We had made a reservation with the expectation of having a set dinner, but when we arrived, we discovered the menu we had been looking at online was no longer available. We were presented with a few other options and in the end, we selected one that everyone could agree on.   This was my first time trying sea cucumber and I'm not sure I'll be jumping at a chance to have it again. The texture was really strange, and it kind of reminded me of chewing on cartilage. Not my favourite, let's leave it at that. My favourite dishes of the evening were the scallops and prawns, the Wok-baked lobster and the fried rice with foie gras. They were packed with flavour and left me wanting more. Every dish was quite good, actually - those were just the standout ones for me.   The dessert was a bit weird, based on comments from a few people in my group. The dessert trio included a soup that consisted of sweetened red bean, which is quite typical for a Chinese dessert and there was a sesame ball with taro inside (I loved this) and a strawberry jelly roll, which I didn't really care for, and was apparently the strangest item in our entire meal, after a very interesting conversation about Chinese desserts.   Service was really good. There were a few people taking care of us, which helped speed things along when it came to plating the food. They would first bring the large platter to our table so we could see (take photos!) and then swiftly move to a serving cart beside our table and divided everything up between 10 dishes. I much prefer this to letting us serve ourselves, and I wish more places would do this. It takes away any chance of someone feeling slighted if, for example, they didn't get the lobster claw, or the 'best' piece of chicken.   It was a pricey meal, at $100 per person - plus tax and tip (not including any drinks you ordered) and it's definitely not somewhere I'd be going often, but it was a nice way to spend a few hours. I would definitely recommend it if you wanted to splurge on dinner.",2
"We came here for Peking Duck around late lunch time and ended up getting dim sum.  Steamed barbecue pork bun: yes! Get this! Flavorful and light. I also enjoyed the pork shrimp and scallop siu mai.  Average items: deep fried mini shrimp ball  Things I didn't care for: deep fried dumpling of Berkshire pork and baby shrimp (tasted like a sesame ball with a filling), baked mini egg tart, steamed soft bun filled with custard, tapioca lychee and mango in chilled sweet soup  DO NOT GET: steamed short spare rib in garlic and toasted garlic. This dish was horrendous! It was slimy!  We weren't too impressed so we left to have another meal around the corner.",0
"Lai Wah Heen used to be the best luxury dim sum restaurant in downtown Toronto. Overtime, the quality of the restaurant declined. While services and atmosphere still remain the same, quality and price are no longer on par.   Out of the four items my brother and I shared, the best item was fried bean curd sheet with mushrooms served with aged balsamic vinegar ($5). It was crispy and juicy. Truffle Snow pea vegetarian wrap was unfortunately subpar ($5.5). The snow pea is not picked and over-steamed.   With that said, it may still be a good option if you are a downtown dweller. However, I would not recommend Lai Wah Heen if you have access to dim sum restaurants in uptown Markham and Richmond Hill.",1
"First of all, let's be clear. Growing up in Asia, I have tasted the best of the best! So I'm not easily impressed by Chinese restaurants overseas. Lai Wah Heen came with rave reviews by Canadians, so I thought I'd check it out and see how it measured up to restaurants in Singapore and Hong Kong.  Verdict - Lai Wah Heen, which is supposedly 5-star here in Toronto, has dim sum that any 3-star restaurants in Singapore (eg. Mid-tier Wah Lok would win hands down) and Hong Kong can easily beat.  The presentation was nice. The taste profile of some of their offerings were decent, but there was only ONE stand-out dish that wowed - and that was the lava custard buns, which were flawlessly executed.  My biggest complaint was the skin on the steamed dumplings. The skin was too thick (especially the lobster dumpling) and chewing through it was laborious.  Overall, it's not worth the price.",0
"Dinner: Peking Duck, 2 courses Spicy Shrimp hot pot with vermicelli Shrimp with black bean sauce  I had not been to Lai Wah Heen in several years, until recently.  The two course peking duck was definitely better than in a normal restaurant. I could tell that the flour wraps were of much higher quality than normal. Perhaps made fresh at the restaurant?  They serve it with the duck, cucumber, green onion already on the wrap, then you can add the sauce on your own. The second course was a pretty standard version of the lettuce wraps.  Spicy Shrimp Hot Pot with Vermicelli was excellent. I would order this dish again without question. The clear vermicelli noodles are a great compliment to the spicy sauce and large shrimp.  Shrimp with black bean sauce was good, but did not stick out as much.  Overall, it was a good meal, but the prices are prohibitive.",1
"Lai Wah Heen offers excellent service and good food. The prices are higher compared to restaurants in Chinatown nearby, but you are paying for better service and food.   The service is always great here. Servers are attentive and friendly. The atmosphere is casual. Overall, I enjoy most of the items I've had here. You will not leave disappointed if you have a dinner here. The service and food are both great.   However, I am only giving it a 3 stars because I think the prices are high for what you get. Yes, the food is better than some of the cheaper restaurants in Chinatown. However, it isn't anything exceptional to me for the price they charge. It is priced higher because it is in a great location perhaps. For the prices here, I am expecting more unique items.",1
The service was really courteous and attentive. The food was really original and tasty with a really authentic feel. A nice calm atmosphere if you are looking to get away from the crowds. Dim sum is top notch and  is made in such inventive ways! Desserts are inventive and light--yummy!,2
"Regardless if you're Chinese food purist or a new age Asian fusion maven, you'll probably find something here that you'll like.   Keep in mind you are dining in the double tree, so you will be paying for everything from the food to the service.   I made a reservation for Christmas Eve dinner and it was quite busy. The star dishes here are really the Peking duck or lobster if you're having a big dinner party. The lobster can be cooked in two different styles, so I would opt for one fried and one steamed so you get some variety. The pork belly here is incredibly tender and the best I've had so far. I would stay away from the dim sum platter, as it leaves much to the imagination. However, their specialty dim sum seem to be a hit, so that may be something I'll have to come back and try.   If you are parking in the hotel underground lot, the restaurant will cover part of the cost!",2
"Stopped by on a Sunday for some dim sum, having visited previously ~6 years ago and recalling an enjoyable visit. Lai Wah Heen is on the second floor of an aging Doubletree Hotel in Chinatown. The hotel has seen better days, but the dining room is fine and clean, if dated. Our experience with the food on this visit was quite mediocre. While nothing was off putting, the flavor and quality were not a good as we had remembered, and certainly a far cry from our best dim sums in China/HK. Honestly, there were no clear highlights. Service was above average for a Chinese venue, i.e. you don't have to flag down a waitress, but nothing to write home about. While we are out-of-towners, believe there are probably better options for dim sum.",0
This was the best dim sum I've had in a very long time. It is the most authentic HK dim sum for all the dishes I ordered. After having a mediocre dim sum recently I was very Happy to have come here. Only thing is that I don't live here...   The steam bao bun was fluffy and had a decent amount of filling. The egg tart was my favorite as it was warm and the custard was nice and rich. The pork belly was an additional bonus. Will have to come and order the Peking Duck on my next visit. Service was great too!!!  Highly recommend. A tad pricey but worth it in IMHO. Can't wait for my next visit!,2
"My aunt recommended Lai Wah Heen Chinese Restaurant to us. There was options to order set menu (set price per person) as well order al carte options. It wasn't your typical dim sum restaurant as it didn't have push carts.  We ordered hot tea and shared eight dim sum dishes including Roast Pork Pastries, Steamed Shrimp Dumplings, Sticky Rice with Meats and Vegetables, Minced Beef and Mandarin Peel in Rice Roll, Chicken and Truffle Dumplings, Steamed Pork, Shrimp, and Scallop Siu Mai, Minced Beef Siu Mai, and Deep Fried Dumplings Filled with Berkshire Pork. My favorite was the Roast Pork Pastries but all of them were yummy and I'd order them again.",2
"High quality, fancy dining with some of the best dim sum I've had in Toronto. The interior was quite elegant (inside the Double Tree Hotel), service was very attentive, and every single dish was delicious.",2
"Lets face it, dim sum can be a stressful experience. The waiting, crowds, loud noises and rushed service can all be off-putting. It may be a big price to pay for those delicious Chinese tapas that we call  dim sum.  Some may argue these unpleasantries are part of the quintessential dim sum experience, but I disagree. I don't like crowds and I don't like noise, so typically I stay away from dim sum. Lai Wah Heen is an exception to the typical Dim Sum experience.  Dim sum at Lai Wah Heen is more like a High Tea experience. It's mostly calm and soothing. The service is impeccable with attentive uniformed waiters. The ambiance is upscale with white tablecloth and minimal ambient noise.   It's pricier than average dim sum. True. But you get what you pay for. All the dishes are very good. The clay pot eel rice is delicious as is the steamed bean curd sheet wrapped with mushrooms. My gf's favorite dish was the steamed chicken with fish maw in rice wine sauce.  Now that my mother lives in condominium close by, Lai Wah Heen may be my new go-to for some ""peaceful"" dim sum. It may be more expensive, but it's worth it in my opinion, since I only get dim sum occasionally.",2
"Very elegant dim sum. We had the tasting lunch. 2nd order at 50%.  I ate here over 15 years ago and looked forward to eating here on my return to Toronto.  The restaurant did not disappoint. Deep-fried prawn coated with shrimp mousse & scallop, wrapped with bacon and the seared crab claw, shrimp & green chive in wonton were both outstanding. I can't wait to return to Toronto to eat here again.",2
"I'm surprised to read all these contrasting, love-or-hate reviews about Lai Wah Heen as I was fairly impressed with my experience here. And this is from someone who comes from a Cantonese background, grew up with dim sum flowing through my veins, and, as such, is very picky and demanding about it.  Yes, the setting in an otherwise aging hotel building (if the public areas are any indication) might not be the most inviting at first, but when you step inside, the first thing you notice is the clean, well-maintained venue that actually looks like a formal dining room - unlike the average unkempt dim sum house. Next, most of the staff appears to be native Cantonese speakers, which is always reassuring in terms of authenticity (although they do speak Mandarin, as many customers insisted). Perhaps, as someone who could speak Cantonese myself, I got friendlier and more engaging service than others would.  Although I got quite the sticker shock when I first reviewed the menu, I was also pleasantly surprised by how well-presented each item was. The lobster and shrimp dumpling, for example, came in the shape of a lobster, and had good chunks of seafood inside. The deep-fried prawn and scallop wrapped in bacon? Exactly as delicious as the description suggests. A steamed beancurd roll of mushrooms and truffle simply rose above typical dim sum fare. Meanwhile, the crispy fried pastry of foie gras and minced pork was also inviting in terms of its presentation - indeed, French-inspired - and also satisfying going down. Dim sum staples like the shrimp dumplings (har gow) and beef rice rolls (cheong fun) were also on point.  Furthermore, while it's all not going to be the best-tasting, best-value dim sum ever, nothing tasted bland or bad either. Just... decent. In another reassuring sign, I experienced none of the suffocating thirstiness afterwards that you'd get from lower-quality dim sum houses that douse their offerings with MSG or salt. Again, another check mark in terms of quality.  Given the effort they put into the presentation and the quality of the ingredients, I was quite satisfied with my visit here, even if it was quite expensive. Is this going to be a cheap, everyday dim sum experience? Absolutely not. But is this going to be a special treat that rises above the usual loud, busy, run-of-the-mill-quality dim sum hall? Absolutely yes.",2
"If you are looking for more fusion dim sum, this is the right place for you. Really love the foie gras tart, the lobster dumpling is pretty good. Didn't like the turnip cake and caviar dumpling as much. Ordered the deep fry veg bean curd roll that's really good too forgot to attach the picture here. The truffle chicken dumplings were okay. It's a little pricy compare with other dim sum restaurants.   I would say the food is 3.5 stars but the price of the parking and service made it to 4 stars.    The parking is cheap as it is located in downtown.",2
"I went to Blooming Orchid restaurant for some takeout food. Blooming Orchid is an Asian fusion restaurant that replaced Duckee restaurant. The staff was very friendly. It took a long time to order as the menu is very cluttered and confusing. They have Chinese food, sushi, dim sum, etc. Normally when a restaurant have so many choices, the food is terrible. The prices were pretty high as their dim sum dishes cost 5 dollars a plate.  I ordered the dim sum no.1 platter which has steamed spinach hai gow, shrimp hai gow, and fried shrimp rolls. I also ordered the salmon rolls. To my great surprise, the food was very good. The fried shrimp rolls were great as it wasn't overcooked. The salmon rolls were also very good.  Would I go back? Sure as the food was very good.",2
"We have ordered from this restaurant numerous times, and we were very satisfied on every occasion. They have sushi, salads, soups, Chinese food, and lots of other yummy options to satisfy your hunger. This is a solid bet if you are craving Asian food in the area.",2
"Yes I gave four stars for AYCE for the most affordable price. The food is above average and service is ok. But for the price of less than $20, you can't go wrong with all you can eat.",2
"We regularly order through a delivery app and I'm yet to be disappointed.  Price point is a bit higher, but I know I'm getting quality food so I'll pay.  Dim sum and Chinese options are what we've always ordered to date and they've been excellent.  If you're looking for fast food Chinese, this is the place.   Dim Sum has always been perfectly flavoured and steamed, it arrives fresh and still hot (I burned my tongue and learned that the hard way).  Don't know if they make this onsite or if it's pre-frozen and steamed onsite, but it works.  $35 for a tray to share with 2-3 people is pretty good for the area- I know you can get cheaper and better in Markham and Mississauga, but if it's 8pm on a Thursday night, I'm ordering in.   Chinese food, whether it's General Tso's chicken or a tofu based main or Singapore noodles, flavours are always well balanced without being overly sweet or overly spicy.  Fried rice is always a go-to and never fails to disappoint.   Looking forward to going in person and checking out some of the other options!",2
"NEVER ORDER FROM THIS RESTAURANT! We order from them at least 10 times a week, from our staff to our agents. And today they showed us how POOR their customer service is. We got food poisoning from their food and one of their employees called us disrespectful names. When we walked over to talk to the manager, one of their employees lied and said he was the manager AND the owner - told us he doesn't believe us and that we don't ever have to order from them again because our money doesn't keep their business open. THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! Save your money and order from a place you would feel valued as a loyal customer instead!",0
"Run don't walk!   Blooming Orchid really lives up to the hype.   I was looking for a new AYCE midtown and found one thanks to Yelp and other reviews!  I will post pics below, the food was fresh, portions were perfect, and the taste was excellent.  The service from Qing nan was flawless, her kind, sweet, and helpful disposition made it an absolute pleasure to dine here during lunch hour. She was working the floor, taking care of all the tables, preparing the deliveries, and taking payment for take-out orders, and still her service was great, jus  They have been open for 7 months now, and they definitely have the right combo, of staff, food, and atmosphere to be around for a long time to come.  The decor was simple, relaxing, and comfortable. The washroom was immaculate and again simply decorated closed off by a frosted swinging glass door to access the area.  Will definitely be back, looking forward to it!  Did I mention lunch buffet was $15.00 Mon-Thurs",2
"It was a cold and windy Friday night, so we were looking to order in some Asian food but I was in the mood to try something new. Lo and behold, I discovered Blooming Orchid on one of the food-delivery websites and later learned that it replaced the horrible, bottom-of-the-barrel Duckee.  The ordering process was easy and the food was here within a half hour, and, far more importantly, everything was still impressively hot.  We decided to share the Szechuan Sauce with Chicken and the Vegetable Pad Thai. Both dishes were definitely a cut above most delivery Asian places in the area, for sure. The Chicken dish contained a healthy assortment of veggies (although the broccoli could've been cut into smaller, more edible pieces), and the Szechuan sauce was tangy and surprisingly spicy.  The Pad Thai was equally good and certainly better than the version you get at most places around here. It didn't have the sweetness that seems to plague most adaptations of the venerable dish, and even though we ordered it without a protein, I still found it to be a very satisfying bowl of food. (I will say that the portion was mostly noodles; where were the veggies?)  Blooming Orchid has instantly become a new go-to for delivery in this area.",2
"When it was brand new there were occasional small problems with the kitchen. For example, appetizers not preceding mains, and the occasional not-quite-hot-enough dish. All that is now in the past. The food is consistently very good, and the prices are more than reasonable. I worry the place will fail for lack of business.  It is never busy at lunch time, and it certainly deserves to be packed all the time. Great value for money.",2
Quick delivery. Everything was nice and hot. The garlic eggplant was sooo good. Pad Thai was average... could have used more sprouts and some peanut. Ordered a curry and a beef dish. Both good. Both came with steamed rice which isn't clear from the menu so no need to order extra rice as I did. Will order again. Eggplant on repeat!,2
"We were on our way to a friends house for the week and stopped in for a little dim sum. The Tom yum soup was fresh and the vegetables were crisp and tasty. We also had the shrimp spring roll, steamed shrimp dumplings and fried pork dumpling.  All were the best we have tasted in a very long time. In addition there was another patron in the restaurant and had been there many and said very was delicious on the menu. Best part it was reasonably priced and no MSG Thank you Blooming Orchid",2
"Got delivery from here. Ordered the Malaysian fried rice, the eggplant dish and spicy fried chicken. The eggplant came with a side soup as well. We actually really liked everything we got. The delivery was fast and free. I think we have found a new take out/delivery favorite in the area.",2
"I've eaten from here 3 times, first 2 times ubereats. Had both pad thai's and the green vegetable curry. The curry (eaten in house) was amazing! The food tasted much better eaten in the actual restaurant as is usually the case. Good vegetarian options, fresh, clean place. Tasty, reasonably priced pan Asian cuisine.",2
"Love this place! We went there when it first opened and have been going back regularly, as well as getting take out.  Staff are super friendly and flexible, if you want to make substitutions. We've tried their sushi, fried rice, noodles, dim sum, and poke bowl and liked it all. The BBQ pork buns are delish too!  Usually when a restaurant does a bunch of different types of food, it's a red flag, but not here.",2
Great service and very extensive menu. I really loved the Shanghai noodles and actually ended up ordering them via Uber eats the day after I ate here for the first time. The pan friend pork dumplings had a thick skin and weren't to my liking but those noodles I would come back for any day. Yum. My friend did the all you cat eat menu and all of her choices looked delicious and she said it was all great.,2
After years of Chinese food drought in our vicinity we finally found fantastic food. The food was tasty and well prepared. A first was that the chow mein kept the sauce separated from the noodles so that they didn't get soggy. We will definitely be returning.,2
Great place. Try shrimp tempura. Defiantly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to enjoy great dinner or lunch.,2
"Friendly service, quick delivery and delicious sushi. Try the salmon roses and dragon on fire roll! A new neighbourhood gem.",2
"We've ordered twice over the past week. It's their Opening Month 10% Discount. This is just a bonus. Ordered three different combinations of Poke. Incredibly fresh and beautifully arranged. Three different rices available, too.",2
"This is the best sushi place I have ever tried in my whole life. The dragon on fire sushi was very tasty and full of ingredients, the wonton soup is the best for hangovers, edamame comes salty, the deep fried cheese wonton was so good me and boyfriend finished the whole portion in less than 5 minutes, the green dragon roll came with fresh avocado and a delicious taste, the shrimp tempura lunch was crispy, and the miso soup was a little bit simple but it has several pieces of tofu inside and It might be just personal taste. All the portions were big, and for the prices the food is amazing. It's definitely a great place if you want to eat great food for a fair price. It's better if you call them to order cause they don't charge for delivery if the bill is more than 25 dollars, and they currently have a 10 % off discount because of their grand opening. Again, completely amazing I assure you it is worth it.",2
I am a new to the area having moved from old China town.  I was very disappointed with the choices in Asian food in the Neighbor. I have had three meals from them takeout.lunch lots of tasty specials very reasonably price.  All our food has been fantastic. Tried Thai Sushi and Chinese all the dishes are great and the service is very friendly and good.,2
Doesn't look like much but my friend and I decided to give it a shot based on amazing reviews and we were super pleasantly surprised! I got the dried noodles and the taste with the sauce was amazing. My friend got the soup version and she said it was amazing as well. Definitely coming back.,2
"The most authentic Wuhan dry noodles ive had in Toronto! Eat it while its hot and fresh.    I heard about this place from an article on wechat. The article calls for the duck wings as the must-have. Unfortunately the wings were sold out on the day I went. Instead, i ordered the duck legs. The other reviewer's right, it really is meat-off-the-bones; very tender and flavourful. You can really taste the spicy kick from the seasonings.    这家做出了超正宗的武汉热干面。从一篇微博看到了这家店，说是ta家鸭翅超级好吃。当时就是奔着鸭翅去的，但他们卖光了。。点了热干面和鸭腿。麻辣味十足，肉很酥很嫩。芝麻酱好香~回味中~",2
"So many unique flavours and must try items!   First of all, I could eat the hot dry noodles every single day. I would not leave without at least trying the noodles. The sesame undertones were perfect, and the noodles had a great kick to them.  I don't think you can really go wrong with the duck wings, legs, or neck. All three are similar yet very different. I found the wings spiciest, but not every one at the table agreed with me. So perhaps there was just a very spicy wing or two. I personally prefer the legs as they aren't as ""bony"" as the legs, but the flavour is so bold on both that both are worth a try. Very strong flavours of anise and Sichuan peppercorns throughout. The pork necks are similar to oxtail in the fact that you need to work around little bones, but they make for a pretty perfect salty snack. I would probably recommend sharing them.",2
"Tasty! It's impossible to walk by this store without first noticing the sweet smell of duck that drifts out of its doors. Drawn by the scent and my curiosity, I came here on a Monday evening not sure what to expect and I left pleasantly surprised.  The restaurant mainly focuses on duck and noodles and gets both of these things right! I ordered the 6 piece duck wings and a hot sesame dry noodle bowl. The duck wings are seasoned in a spicy, sweet dry rub that's flavored with Sichaun peppercorns which lead to a mild numbing flavor after you've eaten it. The duck wings were moist and tender, almost falling off the bone although this was after they were heated up (the restaurant serves them cold). The sesame noodles were nutty and a little spicy (less than the duck) and worked well with the duck.  Other offerings on their menu include duck feet, neck, head, leg, tongue and other parts of the duck as well as a small bubble tea menu. Although I kept to the safer option with the wings, I'm sure the other parts of the duck could be tasty as well, though definitely suited to the more adventurous! The interior has lots of seating and it looks like there are plans to have a backyard patio space. The service was fast and friendly! Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area.",2
"Maybe I didn't know what to expect but the wings are served cool and are mostly skin and bone. Did not do it for me. The noodles were hot and flavorful but the sesame texture is quite chalky and I didn't find myself wanting to eat more than a few big bites full. Mostly just noodles, a little sauce and some garnish.",0
"This is a casual family run restaurant. It's homey and simple. I found the dry noodles quite tasty and in particular I also liked the tofu. The family is quite friendly and they tend to be helpful. I would best describeThis as a tasty ethnic family run business. I do think the Teays and the dishes are uniquely Asian, but that's a good thing. The food also taste quite fresh to me",2
"Very tasty and unique flavours. This has become a weekly go-to place. The dry noodle is delicious, so are the dumplings and the noodle soup. Can't really go wrong. The duck is also a hit and reheats well. :)",2
"The dry noodles are pretty good, super strong sesame flavor. The wings are served cold which I wasn't prepared for so I ended up taking them home and heating them up later. Tasty either way.",2
"This is hands down the best noodle place in Toronto!! The Beef Hot and Dry Noodles are delicious and perfect, and the portion sizes are big and leave you very satisfied. They also have bubble tea!   I have gone here many times for lunch and dinner and each time the service was amazing and the restaurant is very clean. It is also in a trendy area of the city that has a lot of cafes. They also sell duck neck and duck wings, which are very famous delicacies in China, this is the only restaurant in Toronto I know that makes them and it is delicious!",2
